          <h3>Book II</h3>

<a name="start"></a>

<a name="10"></a>Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly, but
<a name="11"></a>Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to Achilles, and
<a name="12"></a>destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In the end he deemed
<a name="13"></a>it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon; so he called
<a name="14"></a>one to him and said to it, "Lying Dream, go to the ships of the Achaeans,
<a name="15"></a>into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to word as I now bid you.
<a name="16"></a>Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take Troy.
<a name="17"></a>There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them
<a name="18"></a>to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans."
<a name="19"></a><br><br>The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached
<a name="20"></a>the ships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found
<a name="21"></a>him in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his head
<a name="22"></a>in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured above
<a name="23"></a>all his councillors, and said:-
<a name="24"></a><br><br>"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his
<a name="25"></a>host and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear
<a name="26"></a>me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who, though he be not
<a name="27"></a>near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get the Achaeans
<a name="28"></a>instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no longer divided
<a name="29"></a>counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and
<a name="30"></a>woe betides the Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you
<a name="31"></a>wake see that it does not escape you."
<a name="32"></a><br><br>The dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely
<a name="33"></a>not to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was to take
<a name="34"></a>the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of Jove, who
<a name="35"></a>had many another hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans and Trojans.
<a name="36"></a>Then presently he woke, with the divine message still ringing in his ears;
<a name="37"></a>so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and over
<a name="38"></a>this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and slung
<a name="39"></a>his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took the imperishable
<a name="40"></a>staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships of the
<a name="41"></a>Achaeans.
<a name="42"></a><br><br>The goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might
<a name="43"></a>herald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent the criers
<a name="44"></a>round to call the people in assembly; so they called them and the people
<a name="45"></a>gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of the elders at the
<a name="46"></a>ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were assembled he laid a cunning
<a name="47"></a>counsel before them.
<a name="48"></a><br><br>"My friends," said he, "I have had a dream from heaven in the dead
<a name="49"></a>of night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor's. It hovered
<a name="50"></a>over my head and said, 'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the
<a name="51"></a>welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock
<a name="52"></a>his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from Jove, who, though
<a name="53"></a>he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get
<a name="54"></a>the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no
<a name="55"></a>longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them over to her
<a name="56"></a>own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this.'
<a name="57"></a>The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons
<a name="58"></a>of the Achaeans. But it will be well that I should first sound them, and
<a name="59"></a>to this end I will tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others
<a name="60"></a>go about among the host and prevent their doing so."
<a name="61"></a><br><br>He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity
<a name="62"></a>and goodwill addressed them thus: "My friends," said he, "princes and councillors
<a name="63"></a>of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had told us of this dream
<a name="64"></a>we should have declared it false, and would have had nothing to do with
<a name="65"></a>it. But he who has seen it is the foremost man among us; we must therefore
<a name="66"></a>set about getting the people under arms."
<a name="67"></a><br><br>With this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred
<a name="68"></a>kings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the people
<a name="69"></a>pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally from some hollow
<a name="70"></a>cave and flit in countless throng among the spring flowers, bunched in
<a name="71"></a>knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude pour from ships and
<a name="72"></a>tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon the wide-watered shore,
<a name="73"></a>while among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them ever
<a name="74"></a>to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the
<a name="75"></a>earth groaned under the tramp of men as the people sought their places.
<a name="76"></a>Nine heralds went crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid
<a name="77"></a>them listen to the kings, till at last they were got into their several
<a name="78"></a>places and ceased their clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding his
<a name="79"></a>sceptre. This was the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn.
<a name="80"></a>Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide and guardian. King Mercury
<a name="81"></a>gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd
<a name="82"></a>of his people. Atreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks,
<a name="83"></a>and Thyestes in his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might
<a name="84"></a>be lord of all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he
<a name="85"></a>addressed the Argives.
<a name="86"></a><br><br>"My friends," he said, "heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven
<a name="87"></a>has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise that
<a name="88"></a>I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has played me
<a name="89"></a>false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss
<a name="90"></a>of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city
<a name="91"></a>in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. It
<a name="92"></a>will be a sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean host, at once so great and
<a name="93"></a>valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in number than themselves; but
<a name="94"></a>as yet the end is not in sight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have
<a name="95"></a>sworn to a solemn covenant, and that they have each been numbered- the
<a name="96"></a>Trojans by the roll of their householders, and we by companies of ten;
<a name="97"></a>think further that each of our companies desired to have a Trojan householder
<a name="98"></a>to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many
<a name="99"></a>a company would have to go without its cup-bearer. But they have in the
<a name="100"></a>town allies from other places, and it is these that hinder me from being
<a name="101"></a>able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove years are gone; the timbers
<a name="102"></a>of our ships have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer. Our wives
<a name="103"></a>and little ones at home look anxiously for our coming, but the work that
<a name="104"></a>we came hither to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as
<a name="105"></a>I say: let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take
<a name="106"></a>Troy."
<a name="107"></a><br><br>With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many
<a name="108"></a>of them as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to and
<a name="109"></a>fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south winds break
<a name="110"></a>from heaven's clouds to lash them; or as when the west wind sweeps over
<a name="111"></a>a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast, even so were they swayed
<a name="112"></a>as they flew with loud cries towards the ships, and the dust from under
<a name="113"></a>their feet rose heavenward. They cheered each other on to draw the ships
<a name="114"></a>into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of them; they began taking
<a name="115"></a>away the stays from underneath them, and the welkin rang with their glad
<a name="116"></a>cries, so eager were they to return.
<a name="117"></a><br><br>Then surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that
<a name="118"></a>was not fated. But Juno said to Minerva, "Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing
<a name="119"></a>Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over the
<a name="120"></a>broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen,
<a name="121"></a>for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their
<a name="122"></a>homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by
<a name="123"></a>man, that they draw not their ships into the sea."
<a name="124"></a><br><br>Minerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the
<a name="125"></a>topmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of the
<a name="126"></a>Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing alone.
<a name="127"></a>He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved and sorry;
<a name="128"></a>so she went close up to him and said, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are
<a name="129"></a>you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be off home to your own
<a name="130"></a>land in this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still
<a name="131"></a>keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy,
<a name="132"></a>far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak fairly
<a name="133"></a>to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the
<a name="134"></a>sea."
<a name="135"></a><br><br>Ulysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak
<a name="136"></a>from him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca, who
<a name="137"></a>waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went straight
<a name="138"></a>up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral, imperishable staff.
<a name="139"></a>With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.
<a name="140"></a><br><br>Whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke
<a name="141"></a>him fairly. "Sir," said he, "this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand
<a name="142"></a>to your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not yet
<a name="143"></a>know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long will
<a name="144"></a>visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us at the council
<a name="145"></a>to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry and do us a mischief;
<a name="146"></a>for the pride of kings is great, and the hand of Jove is with
<a name="147"></a>them."
<a name="148"></a><br><br>But when he came across any common man who was making a noise,
<a name="149"></a>he struck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, "Sirrah, hold your
<a name="150"></a>peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and no
<a name="151"></a>soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all be kings;
<a name="152"></a>it is not well that there should be many masters; one man must be supreme-
<a name="153"></a>one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given the sceptre of sovereignty
<a name="154"></a>over you all."
<a name="155"></a><br><br>Thus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people
<a name="156"></a>hurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as
<a name="157"></a>the thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all
<a name="158"></a>the sea is in an uproar.
<a name="159"></a><br><br>The rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places,
<a name="160"></a>but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- a man of many
<a name="161"></a>words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against all who
<a name="162"></a>were in authority, who cared not what he said, so that he might set the
<a name="163"></a>Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all those that came before
<a name="164"></a>Troy- bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders rounded and
<a name="165"></a>hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point, but there was little
<a name="166"></a>hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses hated him worst of all, for
<a name="167"></a>it was with them that he was most wont to wrangle; now, however, with a
<a name="168"></a>shrill squeaky voice he began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans
<a name="169"></a>were angry and disgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling
<a name="170"></a>at the son of Atreus.
<a name="171"></a><br><br>"Agamemnon," he cried, "what ails you now, and what more do you
<a name="172"></a>want? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever
<a name="173"></a>we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more gold,
<a name="174"></a>which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when I or another
<a name="175"></a>Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl to hide and lie
<a name="176"></a>with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans, should bring
<a name="177"></a>them into such misery. Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let us
<a name="178"></a>sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to stew in his own meeds
<a name="179"></a>of honour, and discover whether we were of any service to him or no. Achilles
<a name="180"></a>is a much better man than he is, and see how he has treated him- robbing
<a name="181"></a>him of his prize and keeping it himself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows
<a name="182"></a>no fight; if he did, son of Atreus, you would never again insult
<a name="183"></a>him."
<a name="184"></a><br><br>Thus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and rebuked
<a name="185"></a>him sternly. "Check your glib tongue, Thersites," said be, "and babble
<a name="186"></a>not a word further. Chide not with princes when you have none to back you.
<a name="187"></a>There is no viler creature come before Troy with the sons of Atreus. Drop
<a name="188"></a>this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor keep harping about
<a name="189"></a>going home. We do not yet know how things are going to be, nor whether
<a name="190"></a>the Achaeans are to return with good success or evil. How dare you gibe
<a name="191"></a>at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded him so many prizes? I tell
<a name="192"></a>you, therefore- and it shall surely be- that if I again catch you talking
<a name="193"></a>such nonsense, I will either forfeit my own head and be no more called
<a name="194"></a>father of Telemachus, or I will take you, strip you stark naked, and whip
<a name="195"></a>you out of the assembly till you go blubbering back to the
<a name="196"></a>ships."
<a name="197"></a><br><br>On this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders
<a name="198"></a>till he dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody
<a name="199"></a>weal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish
<a name="200"></a>as he wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yet
<a name="201"></a>they laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying, "Ulysses
<a name="202"></a>has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council, but he never did
<a name="203"></a>the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this fellow's mouth from
<a name="204"></a>prating further. He will give the kings no more of his
<a name="205"></a>insolence."


<img src="bg.png" data-src="http://travelwithcraig.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Trojan-horse-from-the-movie-Troy.jpg">


<a name="206"></a><br><br>Thus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and Minerva
<a name="207"></a>in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those who were
<a name="208"></a>far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore with all
<a name="209"></a>sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:-
<a name="210"></a><br><br>"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among
<a name="211"></a>all mankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from
<a name="212"></a>Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of Troy,
<a name="213"></a>and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set off homeward.
<a name="214"></a>True it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened. A man chafes
<a name="215"></a>at having to stay away from his wife even for a single month, when he is
<a name="216"></a>on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is now nine long years
<a name="217"></a>that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore, blame the Achaeans if
<a name="218"></a>they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go home empty after so
<a name="219"></a>long a stay- therefore, my friends, be patient yet a little longer that
<a name="220"></a>we may learn whether the prophesyings of Calchas were false or
<a name="221"></a>true.
<a name="222"></a><br><br>"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were
<a name="223"></a>yesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were detained
<a name="224"></a>in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam and the Trojans.
<a name="225"></a>We were ranged round about a fountain offering hecatombs to the gods upon
<a name="226"></a>their holy altars, and there was a fine plane-tree from beneath which there
<a name="227"></a>welled a stream of pure water. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful
<a name="228"></a>serpent out of the ground, with blood-red stains upon its back, and it
<a name="229"></a>darted from under the altar on to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood
<a name="230"></a>of young sparrows, quite small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from
<a name="231"></a>under the leaves, eight in all, and their mother that hatched them made
<a name="232"></a>nine. The serpent ate the poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew
<a name="233"></a>about lamenting her little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about
<a name="234"></a>her and caught her by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had
<a name="235"></a>eaten both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him
<a name="236"></a>become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and
<a name="237"></a>we stood there wondering at that which had come to pass. Seeing, then,
<a name="238"></a>that such a fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas forthwith
<a name="239"></a>declared to us the oracles of heaven. 'Why, Achaeans,' said he, 'are you
<a name="240"></a>thus speechless? Jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, and long ere
<a name="241"></a>it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. As the serpent ate
<a name="242"></a>the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them, which makes nine,
<a name="243"></a>so shall we fight nine years at Troy, but in the tenth shall take the town.'
<a name="244"></a>This was what he said, and now it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore,
<a name="245"></a>all of you, till we take the city of Priam."
<a name="246"></a><br><br>On this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with
<a name="247"></a>the uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. "Shame on you,"
<a name="248"></a>he cried, "to stay talking here like children, when you should fight like
<a name="249"></a>men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we have taken?
<a name="250"></a>Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our drink-offerings and
<a name="251"></a>the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put our trust? We waste our
<a name="252"></a>time in words, and for all our talking here shall be no further forward.
<a name="253"></a>Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose; lead the
<a name="254"></a>Argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme,
<a name="255"></a>and scheme in vain, to get back to Argos ere they have learned whether
<a name="256"></a>Jove be true or a liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that
<a name="257"></a>we should succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction
<a name="258"></a>upon the Trojans. He showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning
<a name="259"></a>on our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has first
<a name="260"></a>lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that
<a name="261"></a>he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such
<a name="262"></a>haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may
<a name="263"></a>meet his doom in the sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear to
<a name="264"></a>my counsel, for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide
<a name="265"></a>your men, Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and
<a name="266"></a>tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if the Achaeans
<a name="267"></a>obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, are brave, and
<a name="268"></a>who are cowards; for they will vie against the other. Thus you shall also
<a name="269"></a>learn whether it is through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man
<a name="270"></a>that you shall fail to take the town."
<a name="271"></a><br><br>And Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, you have again outdone the sons
<a name="272"></a>of the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,
<a name="273"></a>that I had among them ten more such councillors, for the city of King Priam
<a name="274"></a>would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it. But the
<a name="275"></a>son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife. Achilles
<a name="276"></a>and I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I was the first
<a name="277"></a>to offend; if we can be of one mind again, the Trojans will not stave off
<a name="278"></a>destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your morning meal, that our
<a name="279"></a>hosts join in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the ordering of
<a name="280"></a>your shields; give good feeds to your horses, and look your chariots carefully
<a name="281"></a>over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for we shall have no rest,
<a name="282"></a>not for a moment, till night falls to part us. The bands that bear your
<a name="283"></a>shields shall be wet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands shall
<a name="284"></a>weary upon your spears, your horses shall steam in front of your chariots,
<a name="285"></a>and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at
<a name="286"></a>the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to dogs
<a name="287"></a>and vultures."
<a name="288"></a><br><br>Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves
<a name="289"></a>run high before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty headland,
<a name="290"></a>dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as the storms from
<a name="291"></a>every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans rise and hurry in all
<a name="292"></a>directions to their ships. There they lighted their fires at their tents
<a name="293"></a>and got dinner, offering sacrifice every man to one or other of the gods,
<a name="294"></a>and praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the fight.
<a name="295"></a>Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty
<a name="296"></a>son of Saturn, and invited the princes and elders of his host. First he
<a name="297"></a>asked Nestor and King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus,
<a name="298"></a>and sixthly Ulysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his
<a name="299"></a>own accord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round
<a name="300"></a>the bull with the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed, saying,
<a name="301"></a>"Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest upon
<a name="302"></a>the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the night fall,
<a name="303"></a>till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates are consumed with fire.
<a name="304"></a>Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of Hector about his heart, and
<a name="305"></a>that full many of his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round
<a name="306"></a>him."
<a name="307"></a><br><br>Thus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer.
<a name="308"></a>He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil continually.
<a name="309"></a>When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal upon the victim,
<a name="310"></a>they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed it. They cut out the
<a name="311"></a>thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set pieces of
<a name="312"></a>raw meat on the top of them. These they burned upon the split logs of firewood,
<a name="313"></a>but they spitted the inward meats, and held them in the flames to cook.
<a name="314"></a>When the thigh-bones were burned, and they had tasted the inward meats,
<a name="315"></a>they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till
<a name="316"></a>they were done, and drew them off; then, when they had finished their work
<a name="317"></a>and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share,
<a name="318"></a>so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,
<a name="319"></a>Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. "King Agamemnon," said he, "let
<a name="320"></a>us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work that heaven has put
<a name="321"></a>into our hands. Let the heralds summon the people to gather at their several
<a name="322"></a>ships; we will then go about among the host, that we may begin fighting
<a name="323"></a>at once."
<a name="324"></a><br><br>Thus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent
<a name="325"></a>the criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them, and
<a name="326"></a>the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of Atreus chose their
<a name="327"></a>men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among them holding her priceless
<a name="328"></a>aegis that knows neither age nor death. From it there waved a hundred tassels
<a name="329"></a>of pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred oxen.
<a name="330"></a>With this she darted furiously everywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans,
<a name="331"></a>urging them forward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that
<a name="332"></a>he might fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in
<a name="333"></a>their eyes even than returning home in their ships. As when some great
<a name="334"></a>forest fire is raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even
<a name="335"></a>so as they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament
<a name="336"></a>of heaven.
<a name="337"></a><br><br>They were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the
<a name="338"></a>plain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and thither,
<a name="339"></a>glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the fen
<a name="340"></a>is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes pour from ships
<a name="341"></a>and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the ground rang as brass
<a name="342"></a>under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick upon the flower-bespangled
<a name="343"></a>field as leaves that bloom in summer.
<a name="344"></a><br><br>As countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman's homestead
<a name="345"></a>in the time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so did
<a name="346"></a>the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy
<a name="347"></a>them.
<a name="348"></a><br><br>The chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight
<a name="349"></a>began, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when
<a name="350"></a>they have got mixed while feeding; and among them went King Agamemnon,
<a name="351"></a>with a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist like Mars,
<a name="352"></a>and a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that lords it over
<a name="353"></a>the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the son of Atreus stand
<a name="354"></a>peerless among the multitude of heroes.
<a name="355"></a><br><br>And now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me-
<a name="356"></a>for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things,
<a name="357"></a>while we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and princes of
<a name="358"></a>the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so that I could not
<a name="359"></a>name every single one of them though I had ten tongues, and though my voice
<a name="360"></a>failed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless you, O Olympian
<a name="361"></a>Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless,
<a name="362"></a>I will tell the captains of the ships and all the fleet
<a name="363"></a>together.
<a name="364"></a><br><br>Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains
<a name="365"></a>of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis,
<a name="366"></a>and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with Thespeia,
<a name="367"></a>Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium,
<a name="368"></a>and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong
<a name="369"></a>fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea,
<a name="370"></a>and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes
<a name="371"></a>the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich in
<a name="372"></a>vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there
<a name="373"></a>came fifty ships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men
<a name="374"></a>of the Boeotians.
<a name="375"></a><br><br>Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt
<a name="376"></a>in Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble maiden
<a name="377"></a>bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone with Mars
<a name="378"></a>secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. With these there
<a name="379"></a>came thirty ships.
<a name="380"></a><br><br>The Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty
<a name="381"></a>Iphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus, rocky
<a name="382"></a>Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in Anemorea
<a name="383"></a>and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus, and Lilaea
<a name="384"></a>by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains came forty ships,
<a name="385"></a>and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, which were stationed next
<a name="386"></a>to the Boeotians, on their left.
<a name="387"></a><br><br>Ajax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not
<a name="388"></a>so great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a little
<a name="389"></a>man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of the spear he
<a name="390"></a>excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt in Cynus, Opous,
<a name="391"></a>Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and Thronium about the
<a name="392"></a>river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships of the Locrians who dwell
<a name="393"></a>beyond Euboea.
<a name="394"></a><br><br>The fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,
<a name="395"></a>Histiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perched town
<a name="396"></a>of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra; Elephenor of
<a name="397"></a>the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son of Chalcodon, and
<a name="398"></a>chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet of foot and wearing
<a name="399"></a>their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would ever strive to tear open
<a name="400"></a>the corslets of their foes with their long ashen spears. Of these there
<a name="401"></a>came fifty ships.
<a name="402"></a><br><br>And they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great
<a name="403"></a>Erechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove's daughter, Minerva,
<a name="404"></a>fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich sanctuary.
<a name="405"></a>There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him with sacrifices of
<a name="406"></a>bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus, son of Peteos. No man
<a name="407"></a>living could equal him in the marshalling of chariots and foot soldiers.
<a name="408"></a>Nestor could alone rival him, for he was older. With him there came fifty
<a name="409"></a>ships.
<a name="410"></a><br><br>Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside
<a name="411"></a>those of the Athenians.
<a name="412"></a><br><br>The men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns,
<a name="413"></a>with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the vineyard
<a name="414"></a>lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina
<a name="415"></a>and Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud battle-cry, and Sthenelus
<a name="416"></a>son of famed Capaneus. With them in command was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus,
<a name="417"></a>son of Talaus; but Diomed was chief over them all. With these there came
<a name="418"></a>eighty ships.
<a name="419"></a><br><br>Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;
<a name="420"></a>Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old; Hyperesia,
<a name="421"></a>high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land round about Helice;
<a name="422"></a>these sent a hundred ships under the command of King Agamemnon, son of
<a name="423"></a>Atreus. His force was far both finest and most numerous, and in their midst
<a name="424"></a>was the king himself, all glorious in his armour of gleaming bronze- foremost
<a name="425"></a>among the heroes, for he was the greatest king, and had most men under
<a name="426"></a>him.
<a name="427"></a><br><br>And those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills,
<a name="428"></a>Pharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae, Amyclae,
<a name="429"></a>and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these were led by
<a name="430"></a>Menelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and of them there
<a name="431"></a>were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others. Among them went Menelaus
<a name="432"></a>himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for he longed to avenge
<a name="433"></a>the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the sake of
<a name="434"></a>Helen.
<a name="435"></a><br><br>The men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the
<a name="436"></a>river Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum, Helos,
<a name="437"></a>and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy for
<a name="438"></a>ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus lived and reigned,
<a name="439"></a>and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing
<a name="440"></a>Jove, if they should sing against him; whereon they were angry, and maimed
<a name="441"></a>him. They robbed him of his divine power of song, and thenceforth he could
<a name="442"></a>strike the lyre no more. These were commanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene,
<a name="443"></a>and with him there came ninety ships.
<a name="444"></a><br><br>And those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene,
<a name="445"></a>near the tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men
<a name="446"></a>of Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie, and
<a name="447"></a>bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and Parrhasia;
<a name="448"></a>of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, and they had sixty
<a name="449"></a>ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each one of them, but Agamemnon
<a name="450"></a>found them the ships in which to cross the sea, for they were not a people
<a name="451"></a>that occupied their business upon the waters.
<a name="452"></a><br><br>The men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is
<a name="453"></a>enclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock Olene and
<a name="454"></a>Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships, with many
<a name="455"></a>Epeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus and Thalpius- the one,
<a name="456"></a>son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- both of the race of Actor. The
<a name="457"></a>two others were Diores, son of Amarynces, and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes,
<a name="458"></a>son of Augeas.
<a name="459"></a><br><br>And those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt
<a name="460"></a>beyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, and the
<a name="461"></a>son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his father, and
<a name="462"></a>went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came forty
<a name="463"></a>ships.
<a name="464"></a><br><br>Ulysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with
<a name="465"></a>its forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, with the mainland
<a name="466"></a>also that was over against the islands. These were led by Ulysses, peer
<a name="467"></a>of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve ships.
<a name="468"></a><br><br>Thoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in
<a name="469"></a>Pleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for the
<a name="470"></a>great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was
<a name="471"></a>also golden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians to be
<a name="472"></a>their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.
<a name="473"></a><br><br>The famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,
<a name="474"></a>and the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and Lycastus that
<a name="475"></a>lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus and Rhytium, with the
<a name="476"></a>other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete. All these were
<a name="477"></a>led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of murderous Mars. And with these
<a name="478"></a>there came eighty ships.
<a name="479"></a><br><br>Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of stature,
<a name="480"></a>brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These dwelt in Rhodes
<a name="481"></a>which is divided among the three cities of Lindus, Ielysus, and Cameirus,
<a name="482"></a>that lies upon the chalk. These were commanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules
<a name="483"></a>by Astyochea, whom he had carried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis,
<a name="484"></a>after sacking many cities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up,
<a name="485"></a>he killed his father's uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous warrior in
<a name="486"></a>his time, but was then grown old. On this he built himself a fleet, gathered
<a name="487"></a>a great following, and fled beyond the sea, for he was menaced by the other
<a name="488"></a>sons and grandsons of Hercules. After a voyage. during which he suffered
<a name="489"></a>great hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the people divided into three
<a name="490"></a>communities, according to their tribes, and were dearly loved by Jove,
<a name="491"></a>the lord, of gods and men; wherefore the son of Saturn showered down great
<a name="492"></a>riches upon them.
<a name="493"></a><br><br>And Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was the handsomest
<a name="494"></a>man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus-
<a name="495"></a>but he was a man of no substance, and had but a small
<a name="496"></a>following.
<a name="497"></a><br><br>And those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the
<a name="498"></a>city of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded by Pheidippus
<a name="499"></a>and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of Hercules. And with
<a name="500"></a>them there came thirty ships.
<a name="501"></a><br><br>Those again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis;
<a name="502"></a>and those of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called
<a name="503"></a>Myrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which Achilles
<a name="504"></a>was in command. But they now took no part in the war, inasmuch as there
<a name="505"></a>was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed by his ships, furious about
<a name="506"></a>the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had taken from Lyrnessus at his own
<a name="507"></a>great peril, when he had sacked Lyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown
<a name="508"></a>Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor, son of Selepus. For her sake
<a name="509"></a>Achilles was still grieving, but ere long he was again to join
<a name="510"></a>them.


<img src="bg.png" data-src="http://www.hattuscha.de/havafot.jpg">


<a name="511"></a><br><br>And those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus,
<a name="512"></a>sanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea, and
<a name="513"></a>Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus had
<a name="514"></a>been captain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under the earth.
<a name="515"></a>He had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeks in sorrow,
<a name="516"></a>and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a Dardanian warrior
<a name="517"></a>while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil of Troy. Still, though
<a name="518"></a>his people mourned their chieftain, they were not without a leader, for
<a name="519"></a>Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled them; he was son of Iphiclus,
<a name="520"></a>rich in sheep, who was the son of Phylacus, and he was own brother to Protesilaus,
<a name="521"></a>only younger, Protesilaus being at once the elder and the more valiant.
<a name="522"></a>So the people were not without a leader, though they mourned him whom they
<a name="523"></a>had lost. With him there came forty ships.
<a name="524"></a><br><br>And those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrae,
<a name="525"></a>and the populous city of Iolcus, these with their eleven ships were led
<a name="526"></a>by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest of the
<a name="527"></a>daughters of Pelias.
<a name="528"></a><br><br>And those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and rugged
<a name="529"></a>Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and they had
<a name="530"></a>seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good archers; but Philoctetes
<a name="531"></a>was lying in great pain in the Island of Lemnos, where the sons of the
<a name="532"></a>Achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a poisonous water snake. There
<a name="533"></a>he lay sick and sorry, and full soon did the Argives come to miss him.
<a name="534"></a>But his people, though they felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon,
<a name="535"></a>the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them in array.
<a name="536"></a><br><br>Those, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they
<a name="537"></a>that held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were commanded
<a name="538"></a>by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of healing, Podalirius
<a name="539"></a>and Machaon. And with them there came thirty ships.
<a name="540"></a><br><br>The men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia,
<a name="541"></a>with those that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus, these were
<a name="542"></a>led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there came forty
<a name="543"></a>ships.
<a name="544"></a><br><br>Those that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white
<a name="545"></a>city of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was son of Pirithous,
<a name="546"></a>who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to Pirithous on the
<a name="547"></a>day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain savages and drove them
<a name="548"></a>from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoetes was not sole in command,
<a name="549"></a>for with him was Leonteus, of the race of Mars, who was son of Coronus,
<a name="550"></a>the son of Caeneus. And with these there came forty
<a name="551"></a>ships.
<a name="552"></a><br><br>Guneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed
<a name="553"></a>by the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona,
<a name="554"></a>and held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends its waters
<a name="555"></a>into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver eddies of the Peneus,
<a name="556"></a>but flow on the top of them like oil; for the Titaresius is a branch of
<a name="557"></a>dread Orcus and of the river Styx.
<a name="558"></a><br><br>Of the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They
<a name="559"></a>were they that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet
<a name="560"></a>of foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty
<a name="561"></a>ships.
<a name="562"></a><br><br>Such were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O Muse,
<a name="563"></a>was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that followed after
<a name="564"></a>the sons of Atreus?
<a name="565"></a><br><br>Of the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest.
<a name="566"></a>They were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They were of the
<a name="567"></a>same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo, of the silver
<a name="568"></a>bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, and terrible as Mars in
<a name="569"></a>battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was much the foremost so long
<a name="570"></a>as Achilles' anger lasted, for Achilles excelled him greatly and he had
<a name="571"></a>also better horses; but Achilles was now holding aloof at his ships by
<a name="572"></a>reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon, and his people passed their time
<a name="573"></a>upon the sea shore, throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and
<a name="574"></a>in archery. Their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing lotus
<a name="575"></a>and wild celery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners,
<a name="576"></a>for lack of leadership, wandered hither and thither about the host and
<a name="577"></a>went not forth to fight.
<a name="578"></a><br><br>Thus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned
<a name="579"></a>beneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land about
<a name="580"></a>Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even so did the
<a name="581"></a>earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.
<a name="582"></a><br><br>And now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad
<a name="583"></a>news among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young,
<a name="584"></a>at Priam's gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the voice
<a name="585"></a>of Priam's son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed as watchman
<a name="586"></a>for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes, to look out for any sally
<a name="587"></a>of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke, saying, "Old man, you talk
<a name="588"></a>idly, as in time of peace, while war is at hand. I have been in many a
<a name="589"></a>battle, but never yet saw such a host as is now advancing. They are crossing
<a name="590"></a>the plain to attack the city as thick as leaves or as the sands of the
<a name="591"></a>sea. Hector, I charge you above all others, do as I say. There are many
<a name="592"></a>allies dispersed about the city of Priam from distant places and speaking
<a name="593"></a>divers tongues. Therefore, let each chief give orders to his own people,
<a name="594"></a>setting them severally in array and leading them forth to
<a name="595"></a>battle."
<a name="596"></a><br><br>Thus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at
<a name="597"></a>once broke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were opened,
<a name="598"></a>and the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the tramp as
<a name="599"></a>of a great multitude.
<a name="600"></a><br><br>Now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon
<a name="601"></a>the plain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb of
<a name="602"></a>lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their
<a name="603"></a>forces.
<a name="604"></a><br><br>Priam's son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the
<a name="605"></a>Trojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and most valiant
<a name="606"></a>of those who were longing for the fray.
<a name="607"></a><br><br>The Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to Anchises,
<a name="608"></a>when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountain slopes
<a name="609"></a>of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two sons of Antenor, Archilochus
<a name="610"></a>and Acamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.
<a name="611"></a><br><br>They that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men
<a name="612"></a>of substance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are of Trojan
<a name="613"></a>blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo had taught
<a name="614"></a>to use the bow.
<a name="615"></a><br><br>They that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia,
<a name="616"></a>and the high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus and Amphius,
<a name="617"></a>whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Percote,
<a name="618"></a>who excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take part
<a name="619"></a>in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to
<a name="620"></a>destruction.
<a name="621"></a><br><br>They that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos,
<a name="622"></a>and Arisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander-
<a name="623"></a>Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of the breed
<a name="624"></a>that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from
<a name="625"></a>Arisbe.
<a name="626"></a><br><br>Hippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in
<a name="627"></a>fertile Larissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons
<a name="628"></a>of the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.
<a name="629"></a><br><br>Acamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those
<a name="630"></a>that came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.
<a name="631"></a><br><br>Euphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the
<a name="632"></a>Ciconian spearsmen.
<a name="633"></a><br><br>Pyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the
<a name="634"></a>broad waters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the
<a name="635"></a>earth.
<a name="636"></a><br><br>The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from
<a name="637"></a>Enetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held Cytorus
<a name="638"></a>and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river Parthenius,
<a name="639"></a>Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.
<a name="640"></a><br><br>Odius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant
<a name="641"></a>Alybe, where there are mines of silver.
<a name="642"></a><br><br>Chromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill
<a name="643"></a>in augury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by the
<a name="644"></a>hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew others
<a name="645"></a>also of the Trojans.
<a name="646"></a><br><br>Phorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far
<a name="647"></a>country of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray.
<a name="648"></a><br><br>Mesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,
<a name="649"></a>born to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dwelt under
<a name="650"></a>Mt. Tmolus.
<a name="651"></a><br><br>Nastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus
<a name="652"></a>and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the river Maeander
<a name="653"></a>and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were commanded by Nastes and
<a name="654"></a>Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came into the fight with gold
<a name="655"></a>about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was of no avail to save
<a name="656"></a>him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus,
<a name="657"></a>and Achilles bore away his gold.
<a name="658"></a><br><br>Sarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by
<a name="659"></a>the eddying waters of the Xanthus.
