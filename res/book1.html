<a name="start"></a>

<a name="10"></a>Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless
<a name="11"></a>ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to
<a name="12"></a>Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so
<a name="13"></a>were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus,
<a name="14"></a>king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one
<a name="15"></a>another.
<a name="16"></a><br><br>And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was
<a name="17"></a>the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence
<a name="18"></a>upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured
<a name="19"></a>Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to
<a name="20"></a>free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he
<a name="21"></a>bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's wreath
<a name="22"></a>and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who
<a name="23"></a>were their chiefs.
<a name="24"></a><br><br>"Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the gods
<a name="25"></a>who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach
<a name="26"></a>your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her,
<a name="27"></a>in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove."
<a name="28"></a><br><br>On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting
<a name="29"></a>the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,
<a name="30"></a>who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. "Old man," said he,
<a name="31"></a>"let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter.
<a name="32"></a>Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will
<a name="33"></a>not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own
<a name="34"></a>home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do
<a name="35"></a>not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you."
<a name="36"></a><br><br>The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went
<a name="37"></a>by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely
<a name="38"></a>Leto had borne. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow, that protectest
<a name="39"></a>Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou
<a name="40"></a>of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned
<a name="41"></a>your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your
<a name="42"></a>arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans."
<a name="43"></a><br><br>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious
<a name="44"></a>from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder,
<a name="45"></a>and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him.
<a name="46"></a>He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and
<a name="47"></a>his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First
<a name="48"></a>he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts
<a name="49"></a>at the people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were
<a name="50"></a>burning.
<a name="51"></a><br><br>For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon
<a name="52"></a>the tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,
<a name="53"></a>who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them.
<a name="54"></a>Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among
<a name="55"></a>them.
<a name="56"></a><br><br>"Son of Atreus," said he, "I deem that we should now turn roving
<a name="57"></a>home if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and
<a name="58"></a>pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader of
<a name="59"></a>dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus Apollo
<a name="60"></a>is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have broken, or
<a name="61"></a>hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will accept the savour
<a name="62"></a>of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take away the plague from
<a name="63"></a>us."
<a name="64"></a><br><br>With these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest
<a name="65"></a>of augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He
<a name="66"></a>it was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through the
<a name="67"></a>prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With all sincerity
<a name="68"></a>and goodwill he addressed them thus:-
<a name="69"></a><br><br>"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger
<a name="70"></a>of King Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that
<a name="71"></a>you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I shall
<a name="72"></a>offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the Achaeans are
<a name="73"></a>in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger of a king, who
<a name="74"></a>if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge till he has wreaked
<a name="75"></a>it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will protect
<a name="76"></a>me."
<a name="77"></a><br><br>And Achilles answered, "Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon
<a name="78"></a>you from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose oracles
<a name="79"></a>you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you,
<a name="80"></a>while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth- no, not though you
<a name="81"></a>name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the
<a name="82"></a>Achaeans."
<a name="83"></a><br><br>Thereon the seer spoke boldly. "The god," he said, "is angry neither
<a name="84"></a>about vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom Agamemnon has dishonoured,
<a name="85"></a>in that he would not free his daughter nor take a ransom for her; therefore
<a name="86"></a>has he sent these evils upon us, and will yet send others. He will not
<a name="87"></a>deliver the Danaans from this pestilence till Agamemnon has restored the
<a name="88"></a>girl without fee or ransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb
<a name="89"></a>to Chryse. Thus we may perhaps appease him."
<a name="90"></a><br><br>With these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His
<a name="91"></a>heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas
<a name="92"></a>and said, "Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things concerning
<a name="93"></a>me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You have brought
<a name="94"></a>me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come seeing among Danaans,
<a name="95"></a>and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a ransom
<a name="96"></a>for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set my heart on keeping
<a name="97"></a>her in my own house, for I love her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra,
<a name="98"></a>whose peer she is alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments.
<a name="99"></a>Still I will give her up if I must, for I would have the people live, not
<a name="100"></a>die; but you must find me a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives
<a name="101"></a>shall be without one. This is not well; for you behold, all of you, that
<a name="102"></a>my prize is to go elsewhither."
<a name="103"></a><br><br>And Achilles answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond
<a name="104"></a>all mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have no
<a name="105"></a>common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities have
<a name="106"></a>been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made already.
<a name="107"></a>Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants us to sack
<a name="108"></a>the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold."
<a name="109"></a><br><br>Then Agamemnon said, "Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall
<a name="110"></a>not thus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade
<a name="111"></a>me. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and
<a name="112"></a>give up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize in fair
<a name="113"></a>exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or that of Ajax
<a name="114"></a>or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall rue my coming. But
<a name="115"></a>of this we will take thought hereafter; for the present, let us draw a
<a name="116"></a>ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let us put a hecatomb
<a name="117"></a>on board, and let us send Chryseis also; further, let some chief man among
<a name="118"></a>us be in command, either Ajax, or Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus,
<a name="119"></a>mighty warrior that you are, that we may offer sacrifice and appease the
<a name="120"></a>the anger of the god."
<a name="121"></a><br><br>Achilles scowled at him and answered, "You are steeped in insolence
<a name="122"></a>and lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding,
<a name="123"></a>either on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here for any ill
<a name="124"></a>the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel with them. They have not raided
<a name="125"></a>my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests on the rich plains of
<a name="126"></a>Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, both mountain and
<a name="127"></a>sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not
<a name="128"></a>ours- to gain satisfaction from the Trojans for your shameless self and
<a name="129"></a>for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize for
<a name="130"></a>which I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me.
<a name="131"></a>Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do I receive
<a name="132"></a>so good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the better part
<a name="133"></a>of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far the largest,
<a name="134"></a>and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can get and be thankful,
<a name="135"></a>when my labour of fighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to
<a name="136"></a>Phthia; it will be much better for me to return home with my ships, for
<a name="137"></a>I will not stay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for
<a name="138"></a>you."
<a name="139"></a><br><br>And Agamemnon answered, "Fly if you will, I shall make you no prayers
<a name="140"></a>to stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and above all Jove,
<a name="141"></a>the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me as you are,
<a name="142"></a>for you are ever quarrelsome and ill affected. What though you be brave?
<a name="143"></a>Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home, then, with your ships and
<a name="144"></a>comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither for you nor for
<a name="145"></a>your anger; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis
<a name="146"></a>from me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers, but I shall come
<a name="147"></a>to your tent and take your own prize Briseis, that you may learn how much
<a name="148"></a>stronger I am than you are, and that another may fear to set himself up
<a name="149"></a>as equal or comparable with me."
<a name="150"></a><br><br>The son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy
<a name="151"></a>breast was divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and
<a name="152"></a>kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger. While
<a name="153"></a>he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from its scabbard,
<a name="154"></a>Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had sent her in the love she bore
<a name="155"></a>to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his yellow hair, visible
<a name="156"></a>to him alone, for of the others no man could see her. Achilles turned in
<a name="157"></a>amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at once knew that she
<a name="158"></a>was Minerva. "Why are you here," said he, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove?
<a name="159"></a>To see the pride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shall
<a name="160"></a>surely be- he shall pay for this insolence with his
<a name="161"></a>life."
<a name="162"></a><br><br>And Minerva said, "I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to
<a name="163"></a>bid you stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike.
<a name="164"></a>Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him if
<a name="165"></a>you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you- and it shall
<a name="166"></a>surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times as splendid
<a name="167"></a>by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and
<a name="168"></a>obey."
<a name="169"></a><br><br>"Goddess," answered Achilles, "however angry a man may be, he must
<a name="170"></a>do as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear the
<a name="171"></a>prayers of him who has obeyed them."
<a name="172"></a><br><br>He stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust
<a name="173"></a>it back into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to Olympus
<a name="174"></a>among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing
<a name="175"></a>Jove.
<a name="176"></a><br><br>But the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus,
<a name="177"></a>for he was still in a rage. "Wine-bibber," he cried, "with the face of
<a name="178"></a>a dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host in
<a name="179"></a>fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this as you do
<a name="180"></a>death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes from any man who
<a name="181"></a>contradicts you. You devour your people, for you are king over a feeble
<a name="182"></a>folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward you would insult no man. Therefore
<a name="183"></a>I say, and swear it with a great oath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt
<a name="184"></a>sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left
<a name="185"></a>its parent stem upon the mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and
<a name="186"></a>bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians
<a name="187"></a>of the decrees of heaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter
<a name="188"></a>they shall look fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the day
<a name="189"></a>of your distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of Hector,
<a name="190"></a>you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your heart with rage
<a name="191"></a>for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest of the
<a name="192"></a>Achaeans."
<a name="193"></a><br><br>With this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on
<a name="194"></a>the ground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning fiercely
<a name="195"></a>from his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued Nestor,
<a name="196"></a>the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his lips sweeter
<a name="197"></a>than honey. Two generations of men born and bred in Pylos had passed away
<a name="198"></a>under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third. With all sincerity
<a name="199"></a>and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-
<a name="200"></a><br><br>"Of a truth," he said, "a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean
<a name="201"></a>land. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad
<a name="202"></a>at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are so excellent
<a name="203"></a>in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you; therefore be guided
<a name="204"></a>by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend of men even greater than
<a name="205"></a>you are, and they did not disregard my counsels. Never again can I behold
<a name="206"></a>such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd of his people, or as Caeneus,
<a name="207"></a>Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus son of Aegeus, peer of the immortals.
<a name="208"></a>These were the mightiest men ever born upon this earth: mightiest were
<a name="209"></a>they, and when they fought the fiercest tribes of mountain savages they
<a name="210"></a>utterly overthrew them. I came from distant Pylos, and went about among
<a name="211"></a>them, for they would have me come, and I fought as it was in me to do.
<a name="212"></a>Not a man now living could withstand them, but they heard my words, and
<a name="213"></a>were persuaded by them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the
<a name="214"></a>more excellent way. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not
<a name="215"></a>this girl away, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to
<a name="216"></a>Achilles; and you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man
<a name="217"></a>who by the grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon.
<a name="218"></a>You are strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon is stronger
<a name="219"></a>than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus, check your anger,
<a name="220"></a>I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who in the day of battle
<a name="221"></a>is a tower of strength to the Achaeans."
<a name="222"></a><br><br>And Agamemnon answered, "Sir, all that you have said is true, but
<a name="223"></a>this fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord of all,
<a name="224"></a>king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be. Granted that
<a name="225"></a>the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also given him the right
<a name="226"></a>to speak with railing?"
<a name="227"></a><br><br>Achilles interrupted him. "I should be a mean coward," he cried,
<a name="228"></a>"were I to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not
<a name="229"></a>me, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to
<a name="230"></a>your heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl, for
<a name="231"></a>those that take were those also that gave. But of all else that is at my
<a name="232"></a>ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others may see; if
<a name="233"></a>you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood."
<a name="234"></a><br><br>When they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up
<a name="235"></a>the assembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back
<a name="236"></a>to his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company, while
<a name="237"></a>Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty oarsmen.
<a name="238"></a>He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb for the god.
<a name="239"></a>And Ulysses went as captain.
<a name="240"></a><br><br>These, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea.
<a name="241"></a>But the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified
<a name="242"></a>themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered hecatombs
<a name="243"></a>of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the smoke with
<a name="244"></a>the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards
<a name="245"></a>heaven.
<a name="246"></a><br><br>Thus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon
<a name="247"></a>did not forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty
<a name="248"></a>messengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. "Go," said he, "to the
<a name="249"></a>tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and bring her
<a name="250"></a>hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others and take her-
<a name="251"></a>which will press him harder."
<a name="252"></a><br><br>He charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon
<a name="253"></a>they went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tents
<a name="254"></a>and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent and
<a name="255"></a>his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood fearfully
<a name="256"></a>and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak, but he knew
<a name="257"></a>them and said, "Welcome, heralds, messengers of gods and men; draw near;
<a name="258"></a>my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who has sent you for the
<a name="259"></a>girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her and give her to them, but
<a name="260"></a>let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal men, and by the fierceness
<a name="261"></a>of Agamemnon's anger, that if ever again there be need of me to save the
<a name="262"></a>people from ruin, they shall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is
<a name="263"></a>mad with rage and knows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans
<a name="264"></a>may fight by their ships in safety."
<a name="265"></a><br><br>Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis
<a name="266"></a>from the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them
<a name="267"></a>to the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. Then Achilles
<a name="268"></a>went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and looking out upon
<a name="269"></a>the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in prayer to his immortal
<a name="270"></a>mother, "Mother," he cried, "you bore me doomed to live but for a little
<a name="271"></a>season; surely Jove, who thunders from Olympus, might have made that little
<a name="272"></a>glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonour,
<a name="273"></a>and has robbed me of my prize by force."
<a name="274"></a><br><br>As he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was
<a name="275"></a>sitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father. Forthwith
<a name="276"></a>she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down before him as
<a name="277"></a>he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, "My son, why are
<a name="278"></a>you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not from me, but tell
<a name="279"></a>me, that we may know it together."
<a name="280"></a><br><br>Achilles drew a deep sigh and said, "You know it; why tell you
<a name="281"></a>what you know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion,
<a name="282"></a>sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans shared
<a name="283"></a>it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the meed of Agamemnon;
<a name="284"></a>but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the ships of the Achaeans to free
<a name="285"></a>his daughter, and brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in
<a name="286"></a>his hand the sceptre of Apollo, wreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and
<a name="287"></a>he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus who were
<a name="288"></a>their chiefs.
<a name="289"></a><br><br>"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting
<a name="290"></a>the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,
<a name="291"></a>who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back in
<a name="292"></a>anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then the god
<a name="293"></a>sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick on one another,
<a name="294"></a>for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host of the Achaeans. At
<a name="295"></a>last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared to us the oracles
<a name="296"></a>of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we should appease him. Whereon
<a name="297"></a>the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened that which he has since
<a name="298"></a>done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl in a ship to Chryse, and sending
<a name="299"></a>gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from my
<a name="300"></a>tent the daughter of Briseus, whom the Achaeans had awarded to
<a name="301"></a>myself.
<a name="302"></a><br><br>"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus,
<a name="303"></a>and if you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid
<a name="304"></a>of Jove. Ofttimes in my father's house have I heard you glory in that you
<a name="305"></a>alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when the others,
<a name="306"></a>with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put him in bonds. It
<a name="307"></a>was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the hundred-handed
<a name="308"></a>monster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aegaeon, for he is stronger even
<a name="309"></a>than his father; when therefore he took his seat all-glorious beside the
<a name="310"></a>son of Saturn, the other gods were afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then,
<a name="311"></a>to him, remind him of all this, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour
<a name="312"></a>to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships,
<a name="313"></a>and perish on the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their
<a name="314"></a>king, and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to the
<a name="315"></a>foremost of the Achaeans."
<a name="316"></a><br><br>Thetis wept and answered, "My son, woe is me that I should have
<a name="317"></a>borne or suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free from
<a name="318"></a>all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you should
<a name="319"></a>be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers: woe, therefore,
<a name="320"></a>was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will go to the snowy heights
<a name="321"></a>of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile
<a name="322"></a>stay where you are with your ships, nurse your anger against the Achaeans,
<a name="323"></a>and hold aloof from fight. For Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast
<a name="324"></a>among the Ethiopians, and the other gods went with him. He will return
<a name="325"></a>to Olympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his mansion paved with
<a name="326"></a>bronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade
<a name="327"></a>him."
<a name="328"></a><br><br>On this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had
<a name="329"></a>been taken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.
<a name="330"></a>When they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid them
<a name="331"></a>in the ship's hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the mast into
<a name="332"></a>its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would have her lie;
<a name="333"></a>there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast the hawsers. They
<a name="334"></a>then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis
<a name="335"></a>also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the altar to deliver her into
<a name="336"></a>the hands of her father. "Chryses," said he, "King Agamemnon has sent me
<a name="337"></a>to bring you back your child, and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf
<a name="338"></a>of the Danaans, that we may propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow
<a name="339"></a>upon the Argives."
<a name="340"></a><br><br>So saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her
<a name="341"></a>gladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of
<a name="342"></a>the god. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle
<a name="343"></a>over the victims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on
<a name="344"></a>their behalf. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow, that protectest
<a name="345"></a>Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou
<a name="346"></a>didst hear me aforetime when I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the
<a name="347"></a>Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful pestilence from the
<a name="348"></a>Danaans."

<a name="349"></a><br><br>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done
<a name="350"></a>praying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of the
<a name="351"></a>victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped
<a name="352"></a>them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat on the top
<a name="353"></a>of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood fire and poured wine over
<a name="354"></a>them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their
<a name="355"></a>hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward
<a name="356"></a>meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted
<a name="357"></a>them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finished
<a name="358"></a>their work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his
<a name="359"></a>full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough
<a name="360"></a>to eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water and
<a name="361"></a>handed it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.
<a name="362"></a><br><br>Thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning
<a name="363"></a>him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their
<a name="364"></a>voices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid themselves
<a name="365"></a>down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when the child of morning,
<a name="366"></a>rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set sail for the host of the Achaeans.
<a name="367"></a>Apollo sent them a fair wind, so they raised their mast and hoisted their
<a name="368"></a>white sails aloft. As the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through
<a name="369"></a>the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.
<a name="370"></a>When they reached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the
<a name="371"></a>vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath
<a name="372"></a>her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.
<a name="373"></a><br><br>But Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not
<a name="374"></a>to the honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed
<a name="375"></a>at his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.
<a name="376"></a><br><br>Now after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to
<a name="377"></a>Olympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her
<a name="378"></a>son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through
<a name="379"></a>great heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty
<a name="380"></a>son of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. She sat herself
<a name="381"></a>down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while with her
<a name="382"></a>right she caught him under the chin, and besought him,
<a name="383"></a>saying-
<a name="384"></a><br><br>"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the
<a name="385"></a>immortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is to be
<a name="386"></a>cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking his prize
<a name="387"></a>and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord of counsel, and
<a name="388"></a>grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give my son his due and
<a name="389"></a>load him with riches in requital."
<a name="390"></a><br><br>Jove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still
<a name="391"></a>kept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. "Incline your
<a name="392"></a>head," said she, "and promise me surely, or else deny me- for you have
<a name="393"></a>nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly you disdain
<a name="394"></a>me."
<a name="395"></a><br><br>At this Jove was much troubled and answered, "I shall have trouble
<a name="396"></a>if you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with her taunting
<a name="397"></a>speeches; even now she is always railing at me before the other gods and
<a name="398"></a>accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back now, lest she should
<a name="399"></a>find out. I will consider the matter, and will bring it about as wish.
<a name="400"></a>See, I incline my head that you believe me. This is the most solemn that
<a name="401"></a>I can give to any god. I never recall my word, or deceive, or fail to do
<a name="402"></a>what I say, when I have nodded my head."
<a name="403"></a><br><br>As he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial
<a name="404"></a>locks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus
<a name="405"></a>reeled.
<a name="406"></a><br><br>When the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to his
<a name="407"></a>house, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged
<a name="408"></a>into the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the
<a name="409"></a>coming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but all
<a name="410"></a>stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. But Juno,
<a name="411"></a>when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman's daughter, silver-footed
<a name="412"></a>Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began to upbraid him.
<a name="413"></a>"Trickster," she cried, "which of the gods have you been taking into your
<a name="414"></a>counsels now? You are always settling matters in secret behind my back,
<a name="415"></a>and have never yet told me, if you could help it, one word of your
<a name="416"></a>intentions."
<a name="417"></a><br><br>"Juno," replied the sire of gods and men, "you must not expect
<a name="418"></a>to be informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find
<a name="419"></a>it hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is
<a name="420"></a>no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a
<a name="421"></a>matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions."
<a name="422"></a><br><br>"Dread son of Saturn," answered Juno, "what are you talking about?
<a name="423"></a>I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in everything.
<a name="424"></a>Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman's daughter Thetis
<a name="425"></a>has been talking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your knees
<a name="426"></a>this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that you have been promising
<a name="427"></a>her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much people at the ships of
<a name="428"></a>the Achaeans."
<a name="429"></a><br><br>"Wife," said Jove, "I can do nothing but you suspect me and find
<a name="430"></a>it out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the more,
<a name="431"></a>and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say; I mean to
<a name="432"></a>have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for if I once begin
<a name="433"></a>to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were on your side it would
<a name="434"></a>profit you nothing."
<a name="435"></a><br><br>On this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and
<a name="436"></a>sat down in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout
<a name="437"></a>the house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and pacify
<a name="438"></a>his mother Juno. "It will be intolerable," said he, "if you two fall to
<a name="439"></a>wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of mortals. If such
<a name="440"></a>ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our banquet.
<a name="441"></a>Let me then advise my mother- and she must herself know that it will be
<a name="442"></a>better- to make friends with my dear father Jove, lest he again scold her
<a name="443"></a>and disturb our feast. If the Olympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from
<a name="444"></a>our seats, he can do so, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair
<a name="445"></a>words, and he will then soon be in a good humour with
<a name="446"></a>us."
<a name="447"></a><br><br>As he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his
<a name="448"></a>mother's hand. "Cheer up, my dear mother," said he, "and make the best
<a name="449"></a>of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a thrashing;
<a name="450"></a>however grieved I might be, I could not help for there is no standing against
<a name="451"></a>Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you, he caught me by the foot
<a name="452"></a>and flung me from the heavenly threshold. All day long from morn till eve,
<a name="453"></a>was I falling, till at sunset I came to ground in the island of Lemnos,
<a name="454"></a>and there I lay, with very little life left in me, till the Sintians came
<a name="455"></a>and tended me."
<a name="456"></a><br><br>Juno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her
<a name="457"></a>son's hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served
<a name="458"></a>it round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed gods
<a name="459"></a>laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ing bustling about the heavenly
<a name="460"></a>mansion.
<a name="461"></a><br><br>Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they
<a name="462"></a>feasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.
<a name="463"></a>Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices, calling
<a name="464"></a>and answering one another. But when the sun's glorious light had faded,
<a name="465"></a>they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame Vulcan with his
<a name="466"></a>consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the Olympian Lord of
<a name="467"></a>Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept; and when he had
<a name="468"></a>got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden throne by his
<a name="469"></a>side.
