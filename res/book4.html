          <h3>Book IV</h3>

<a name="start"></a>

<a name="10"></a>Now the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor while
<a name="11"></a>Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as they pledged
<a name="12"></a>one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon the town of Troy.
<a name="13"></a>The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno, talking at her so as to provoke
<a name="14"></a>her. "Menelaus," said he, "has two good friends among the goddesses, Juno
<a name="15"></a>of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but they only sit still and look on,
<a name="16"></a>while Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus' side to defend him in any danger;
<a name="17"></a>indeed she has just rescued him when he made sure that it was all over
<a name="18"></a>with him- for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We must consider
<a name="19"></a>what we shall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make
<a name="20"></a>peace between them? If you will agree to this last Menelaus can take back
<a name="21"></a>Helen and the city of Priam may remain still inhabited."
<a name="22"></a><br><br>Minerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by
<a name="23"></a>side hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father,
<a name="24"></a>for she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but Juno could
<a name="25"></a>not contain herself. "Dread son of Saturn," said she, "what, pray, is the
<a name="26"></a>meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go for nothing, and the sweat
<a name="27"></a>that I have sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while getting the people
<a name="28"></a>together against Priam and his children? Do as you will, but we other gods
<a name="29"></a>shall not all of us approve your counsel."
<a name="30"></a><br><br>Jove was angry and answered, "My dear, what harm have Priam and
<a name="31"></a>his sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of Ilius?
<a name="32"></a>Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat Priam raw,
<a name="33"></a>with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it your own way then;
<a name="34"></a>for I would not have this matter become a bone of contention between us.
<a name="35"></a>I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, if ever I want to sack
<a name="36"></a>a city belonging to friends of yours, you must not try to stop me; you
<a name="37"></a>will have to let me do it, for I am giving in to you sorely against my
<a name="38"></a>will. Of all inhabited cities under the sun and stars of heaven, there
<a name="39"></a>was none that I so much respected as Ilius with Priam and his whole people.
<a name="40"></a>Equitable feasts were never wanting about my altar, nor the savour of burning
<a name="41"></a>fat, which is honour due to ourselves."
<a name="42"></a><br><br>"My own three favourite cities," answered Juno, "are Argos, Sparta,
<a name="43"></a>and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased with them. I shall
<a name="44"></a>not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and tried to stay
<a name="45"></a>you, I should take nothing by it, for you are much stronger than I am,
<a name="46"></a>but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a god and of the same
<a name="47"></a>race with yourself. I am Saturn's eldest daughter, and am honourable not
<a name="48"></a>on this ground only, but also because I am your wife, and you are king
<a name="49"></a>over the gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take between us, and
<a name="50"></a>the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva to go and take
<a name="51"></a>part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that the Trojans shall
<a name="52"></a>be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans."
<a name="53"></a><br><br>The sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva,
<a name="54"></a>"Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that the Trojans
<a name="55"></a>shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the
<a name="56"></a>Achaeans."
<a name="57"></a><br><br>This was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted
<a name="58"></a>from the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as some brilliant
<a name="59"></a>meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a sign to mariners
<a name="60"></a>or to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows in its wake.
<a name="61"></a>The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld, and one would
<a name="62"></a>turn to his neighbour, saying, "Either we shall again have war and din
<a name="63"></a>of combat, or Jove the lord of battle will now make peace between
<a name="64"></a>us."
<a name="65"></a><br><br>Thus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus,
<a name="66"></a>son of Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find Pandarus,
<a name="67"></a>the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing among the stalwart
<a name="68"></a>heroes who had followed him from the banks of the Aesopus, so she went
<a name="69"></a>close up to him and said, "Brave son of Lycaon, will you do as I tell you?
<a name="70"></a>If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you will win honour and thanks from
<a name="71"></a>all the Trojans, and especially from prince Alexandrus- he would be the
<a name="72"></a>first to requite you very handsomely if he could see Menelaus mount his
<a name="73"></a>funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand. Take your home aim then,
<a name="74"></a>and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer; vow that when you get home
<a name="75"></a>to your strong city of Zelea you will offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs
<a name="76"></a>in his honour."
<a name="77"></a><br><br>His fool's heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case.
<a name="78"></a>This bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed as
<a name="79"></a>it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen as the
<a name="80"></a>arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms long, and a
<a name="81"></a>worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them well down, and
<a name="82"></a>giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung his bow he laid it carefully
<a name="83"></a>on the ground, and his brave followers held their shields before him lest
<a name="84"></a>the Achaeans should set upon him before he had shot Menelaus. Then he opened
<a name="85"></a>the lid of his quiver and took out a winged arrow that had yet been shot,
<a name="86"></a>fraught with the pangs of death. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed
<a name="87"></a>to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his
<a name="88"></a>strong city of Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his
<a name="89"></a>honour. He laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drew
<a name="90"></a>both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near the bow;
<a name="91"></a>then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, and the bow
<a name="92"></a>twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly on over the heads
<a name="93"></a>of the throng.
<a name="94"></a><br><br>But the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove's
<a name="95"></a>daughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee and ward
<a name="96"></a>off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a mother whisks
<a name="97"></a>a fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly; she guided it to
<a name="98"></a>the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over his double
<a name="99"></a>cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that went tightly round
<a name="100"></a>him. It went right through this and through the cuirass of cunning workmanship;
<a name="101"></a>it also pierced the belt beneath it, which he wore next his skin to keep
<a name="102"></a>out darts or arrows; it was this that served him in the best stead, nevertheless
<a name="103"></a>the arrow went through it and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood
<a name="104"></a>began flowing from the wound.
<a name="105"></a><br><br>As when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to
<a name="106"></a>a piece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be
<a name="107"></a>laid up in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it, but the
<a name="108"></a>king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver may be proud-
<a name="109"></a>even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your legs down to your
<a name="110"></a>fair ancles stained with blood.
<a name="111"></a><br><br>When King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was
<a name="112"></a>afraid, and so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs of
<a name="113"></a>the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft were still
<a name="114"></a>outside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved a deep sigh
<a name="115"></a>as he held Menelaus's hand in his own, and his comrades made moan in concert.
<a name="116"></a>"Dear brother, "he cried, "I have been the death of you in pledging this
<a name="117"></a>covenant and letting you come forward as our champion. The Trojans have
<a name="118"></a>trampled on their oaths and have wounded you; nevertheless the oath, the
<a name="119"></a>blood of lambs, the drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship in
<a name="120"></a>which have put our trust shall not be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil
<a name="121"></a>it not here and now, he. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay
<a name="122"></a>dearly with their lives and with their wives and children. The day will
<a name="123"></a>surely come when mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam's
<a name="124"></a>people, when the son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them
<a name="125"></a>with his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This shall
<a name="126"></a>surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot now
<a name="127"></a>to die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans will at
<a name="128"></a>once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping
<a name="129"></a>Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie here at Troy with your
<a name="130"></a>purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart Trojan leap upon your tomb
<a name="131"></a>and say, 'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak his vengeance; he brought his army
<a name="132"></a>in vain; he is gone home to his own land with empty ships, and has left
<a name="133"></a>Menelaus behind him.' Thus will one of them say, and may the earth then
<a name="134"></a>swallow me."
<a name="135"></a><br><br>But Menelaus reassured him and said, "Take heart, and do not alarm
<a name="136"></a>the people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer
<a name="137"></a>belt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass and
<a name="138"></a>the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me."
<a name="139"></a><br><br>And Agamemnon answered, "I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be
<a name="140"></a>even so, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it
<a name="141"></a>to relieve your pain."
<a name="142"></a><br><br>He then said to Talthybius, "Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the
<a name="143"></a>great physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately. Some
<a name="144"></a>Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our dismay, and
<a name="145"></a>to his own great glory."
<a name="146"></a><br><br>Talthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to
<a name="147"></a>find Machaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors who had
<a name="148"></a>followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and said, "Son of Aesculapius,
<a name="149"></a>King Agamemnon says you are to come and see Menelaus immediately. Some
<a name="150"></a>Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our dismay and
<a name="151"></a>to his own great glory."
<a name="152"></a><br><br>Thus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed through
<a name="153"></a>the spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they came to the place
<a name="154"></a>where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with the chieftains gathered
<a name="155"></a>in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the middle of the ring and at
<a name="156"></a>once drew the arrow from the belt, bending its barbs back through the force
<a name="157"></a>with which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished belt, and beneath this
<a name="158"></a>the cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths had made; then,
<a name="159"></a>when he had seen the wound, he wiped away the blood and applied some soothing
<a name="160"></a>drugs which Chiron had given to Aesculapius out of the good will he bore
<a name="161"></a>him.
<a name="162"></a><br><br>While they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward
<a name="163"></a>against them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed the
<a name="164"></a>fight.
<a name="165"></a><br><br>You would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and
<a name="166"></a>unwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot
<a name="167"></a>rich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of
<a name="168"></a>Ptolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness against
<a name="169"></a>the time his limbs should weary of going about and giving orders to so
<a name="170"></a>many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw men hasting to the
<a name="171"></a>front he stood by them and cheered them on. "Argives," said he, "slacken
<a name="172"></a>not one whit in your onset; father Jove will be no helper of liars; the
<a name="173"></a>Trojans have been the first to break their oaths and to attack us; therefore
<a name="174"></a>they shall be devoured of vultures; we shall take their city and carry
<a name="175"></a>off their wives and children in our ships."
<a name="176"></a><br><br>But he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined
<a name="177"></a>to fight. "Argives," he cried, "cowardly miserable creatures, have you
<a name="178"></a>no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longer
<a name="179"></a>scud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight? You are as dazed
<a name="180"></a>and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans reach the sterns
<a name="181"></a>of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whether the son of Saturn
<a name="182"></a>will hold his hand over you to protect you?"
<a name="183"></a><br><br>Thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing
<a name="184"></a>through the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round Idomeneus,
<a name="185"></a>who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones was bringing
<a name="186"></a>up the battalions that were in the rear. Agamemnon was glad when he saw
<a name="187"></a>him, and spoke him fairly. "Idomeneus," said he, "I treat you with greater
<a name="188"></a>distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans, whether in war or in
<a name="189"></a>other things, or at table. When the princes are mixing my choicest wines
<a name="190"></a>in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed allowance, but your
<a name="191"></a>cup is kept always full like my own, that you may drink whenever you are
<a name="192"></a>minded. Go, therefore, into battle, and show yourself the man you have
<a name="193"></a>been always proud to be."
<a name="194"></a><br><br>Idomeneus answered, "I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised
<a name="195"></a>you from the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we may
<a name="196"></a>join battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their covenants.
<a name="197"></a>Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have been the first
<a name="198"></a>to break their oaths and to attack us."
<a name="199"></a><br><br>The son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the
<a name="200"></a>two Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when a goat-herd
<a name="201"></a>from some high post watches a storm drive over the deep before the west
<a name="202"></a>wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mighty whirlwind draws towards
<a name="203"></a>him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock into a cave- even thus did
<a name="204"></a>the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark mass to battle under the Ajaxes,
<a name="205"></a>horrid with shield and spear. Glad was King Agamemnon when he saw them.
<a name="206"></a>"No need," he cried, "to give orders to such leaders of the Argives as
<a name="207"></a>you are, for of your own selves you spur your men on to fight with might
<a name="208"></a>and main. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo that all were so minded
<a name="209"></a>as you are, for the city of Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands,
<a name="210"></a>and we should sack it."
<a name="211"></a><br><br>With this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker
<a name="212"></a>of the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in company
<a name="213"></a>with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd of his people.
<a name="214"></a>He placed his knights with their chariots and horses in the front rank,
<a name="215"></a>while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom he could trust, were
<a name="216"></a>in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle, that they might fight
<a name="217"></a>whether they would or no. He gave his orders to the knights first, bidding
<a name="218"></a>them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid confusion. "Let no
<a name="219"></a>man," he said, "relying on his strength or horsemanship, get before the
<a name="220"></a>others and engage singly with the Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or
<a name="221"></a>you will weaken your attack; but let each when he meets an enemy's chariot
<a name="222"></a>throw his spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men
<a name="223"></a>of old took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they
<a name="224"></a>minded."
<a name="225"></a><br><br>Thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight,
<a name="226"></a>and King Agamemnon was glad. "I wish," he said to him, that your limbs
<a name="227"></a>were as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age,
<a name="228"></a>the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that it
<a name="229"></a>had fallen upon some other, and that you were still
<a name="230"></a>young."
<a name="231"></a><br><br>And Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, "Son of Atreus, I too would
<a name="232"></a>gladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but the gods will
<a name="233"></a>not give us everything at one and the same time. I was then young, and
<a name="234"></a>now I am old; still I can go with my knights and give them that counsel
<a name="235"></a>which old men have a right to give. The wielding of the spear I leave to
<a name="236"></a>those who are younger and stronger than myself."
<a name="237"></a><br><br>Agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,
<a name="238"></a>son of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the Athenians loud
<a name="239"></a>of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning Ulysses, with his sturdy
<a name="240"></a>Cephallenians round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry, for the
<a name="241"></a>ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only just begun to move, so they were
<a name="242"></a>standing still, waiting for some other columns of the Achaeans to attack
<a name="243"></a>the Trojans and begin the fighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked
<a name="244"></a>them and said, "Son of Peteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart
<a name="245"></a>of guile, why stand you here cowering and waiting on others? You two should
<a name="246"></a>be of all men foremost when there is hard fighting to be done, for you
<a name="247"></a>are ever foremost to accept my invitation when we councillors of the Achaeans
<a name="248"></a>are holding feast. You are glad enough then to take your fill of roast
<a name="249"></a>meats and to drink wine as long as you please, whereas now you would not
<a name="250"></a>care though you saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the enemy in front of
<a name="251"></a>you."
<a name="252"></a><br><br>Ulysses glared at him and answered, "Son of Atreus, what are you
<a name="253"></a>talking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans are
<a name="254"></a>in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do so, that
<a name="255"></a>the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost of them. You
<a name="256"></a>are talking idly."
<a name="257"></a><br><br>When Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly
<a name="258"></a>at him and withdrew his words. "Ulysses," said he, "noble son of Laertes,
<a name="259"></a>excellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders
<a name="260"></a>to give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are of
<a name="261"></a>a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and if any
<a name="262"></a>ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing."
<a name="263"></a><br><br>He then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son
<a name="264"></a>of Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with Sthenelus
<a name="265"></a>the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to upbraid him. "Son of
<a name="266"></a>Tydeus," he said, "why stand you cowering here upon the brink of battle?
<a name="267"></a>Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever ahead of his men when leading
<a name="268"></a>them on against the foe- so, at least, say they that saw him in battle,
<a name="269"></a>for I never set eyes upon him myself. They say that there was no man like
<a name="270"></a>him. He came once to Mycenae, not as an enemy but as a guest, in company
<a name="271"></a>with Polynices to recruit his forces, for they were levying war against
<a name="272"></a>the strong city of Thebes, and prayed our people for a body of picked men
<a name="273"></a>to help them. The men of Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but
<a name="274"></a>Jove dissuaded them by showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore,
<a name="275"></a>and Polynices went their way. When they had got as far the deep-meadowed
<a name="276"></a>and rush-grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as their
<a name="277"></a>envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet
<a name="278"></a>in the house of Eteocles. Stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding
<a name="279"></a>himself single-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests of
<a name="280"></a>all kinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily
<a name="281"></a>did Minerva help him. The Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set
<a name="282"></a>a force of fifty youths with two captains- the godlike hero Maeon, son
<a name="283"></a>of Haemon, and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head, to lie in
<a name="284"></a>wait for him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them,
<a name="285"></a>save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven's omens. Such was
<a name="286"></a>Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he cannot fight as
<a name="287"></a>his father did."
<a name="288"></a><br><br>Diomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;
<a name="289"></a>but the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, "Son of Atreus, tell
<a name="290"></a>no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast ourselves as even
<a name="291"></a>better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated Thebes, though the wall
<a name="292"></a>was stronger and our men were fewer in number, for we trusted in the omens
<a name="293"></a>of the gods and in the help of Jove, whereas they perished through their
<a name="294"></a>own sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like honour with
<a name="295"></a>us."
<a name="296"></a><br><br>Diomed looked sternly at him and said, "Hold your peace, my friend,
<a name="297"></a>as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the Achaeans forward,
<a name="298"></a>for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his the shame if we
<a name="299"></a>are vanquished. Therefore let us acquit ourselves with
<a name="300"></a>valour."
<a name="301"></a><br><br>As he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so
<a name="302"></a>fiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have been scared
<a name="303"></a>to hear it.
<a name="304"></a><br><br>As when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west
<a name="305"></a>wind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and now comes
<a name="306"></a>crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over the jagged
<a name="307"></a>rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions- even so did the serried
<a name="308"></a>phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to battle. The chiefs gave orders
<a name="309"></a>each to his own people, but the men said never a word; no man would think
<a name="310"></a>it, for huge as the host was, it seemed as though there was not a tongue
<a name="311"></a>among them, so silent were they in their obedience; and as they marched
<a name="312"></a>the armour about their bodies glistened in the sun. But the clamour of
<a name="313"></a>the Trojan ranks was as that of many thousand ewes that stand waiting to
<a name="314"></a>be milked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly
<a name="315"></a>in answer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not one speech nor
<a name="316"></a>language, but their tongues were diverse, and they came from many different
<a name="317"></a>places. These were inspired of Mars, but the others by Minerva- and with
<a name="318"></a>them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and friend
<a name="319"></a>of murderous Mars, who, from being at first but low in stature, grows till
<a name="320"></a>she uprears her head to heaven, though her feet are still on earth. She
<a name="321"></a>it was that went about among them and flung down discord to the waxing
<a name="322"></a>of sorrow with even hand between them.
<a name="323"></a><br><br>When they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield
<a name="324"></a>and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed shields beat one
<a name="325"></a>upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude- death-cry
<a name="326"></a>and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with blood.
<a name="327"></a>As torrents swollen with rain course madly down their deep channels till
<a name="328"></a>the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd the hillside hears
<a name="329"></a>their roaring from afar- even such was the toil and uproar of the hosts
<a name="330"></a>as they joined in battle.
<a name="331"></a><br><br>First Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,
<a name="332"></a>son of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the projecting
<a name="333"></a>part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the point of bronze
<a name="334"></a>pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; headlong as a tower he
<a name="335"></a>fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped King Elephenor, son
<a name="336"></a>of Chalcodon and captain of the proud Abantes began dragging him out of
<a name="337"></a>reach of the darts that were falling around him, in haste to strip him
<a name="338"></a>of his armour. But his purpose was not for long; Agenor saw him haling
<a name="339"></a>the body away, and smote him in the side with his bronze-shod spear- for
<a name="340"></a>as he stooped his side was left unprotected by his shield- and thus he
<a name="341"></a>perished. Then the fight between Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over
<a name="342"></a>his body, and they flew upon each other like wolves, man and man crushing
<a name="343"></a>one upon the other.
<a name="344"></a><br><br>Forthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius,
<a name="345"></a>son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois, as she
<a name="346"></a>was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her parents to see
<a name="347"></a>their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he did not live to
<a name="348"></a>pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off untimely by the spear
<a name="349"></a>of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right nipple as he
<a name="350"></a>was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear went right through
<a name="351"></a>his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and tall
<a name="352"></a>in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with branches. Then the
<a name="353"></a>wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that he may fashion a felloe for
<a name="354"></a>the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it lies seasoning by the waterside.
<a name="355"></a>In such wise did Ajax fell to earth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon
<a name="356"></a>Antiphus of the gleaming corslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax
<a name="357"></a>from amid the crowd and missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade
<a name="358"></a>of Ulysses, in the groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over
<a name="359"></a>to the other side; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it.
<a name="360"></a>Ulysses was furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armour
<a name="361"></a>through the front ranks till he was quite close; then he glared round about
<a name="362"></a>him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart was
<a name="363"></a>not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam, who
<a name="364"></a>had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge of his father's mares.
<a name="365"></a>Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with his spear
<a name="366"></a>on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the other side of his
<a name="367"></a>forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and his armour rang rattling
<a name="368"></a>round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Hector, and they that were
<a name="369"></a>in front, then gave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off
<a name="370"></a>the dead, pressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down
<a name="371"></a>from Pergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased. "Trojans,"
<a name="372"></a>he cried, "rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves be thus beaten by
<a name="373"></a>the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron that when hit them you
<a name="374"></a>do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of lovely Thetis, is not fighting,
<a name="375"></a>but is nursing his anger at the ships."
<a name="376"></a><br><br>Thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while
<a name="377"></a>Jove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the host
<a name="378"></a>of the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them
<a name="379"></a>slackening.
<a name="380"></a><br><br>Then fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck
<a name="381"></a>by a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled it was
<a name="382"></a>Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come from Aenus;
<a name="383"></a>the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the pitiless stone. He fell
<a name="384"></a>to the ground on his back, and in his death throes stretched out his hands
<a name="385"></a>towards his comrades. But Peirous, who had wounded him, sprang on him and
<a name="386"></a>thrust a spear into his belly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon
<a name="387"></a>the ground, and darkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas
<a name="388"></a>of Aetolia struck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point fixed
<a name="389"></a>itself in his lungs. Thoas came close up to him, pulled the spear out of
<a name="390"></a>his chest, and then drawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly
<a name="391"></a>so that he died; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian
<a name="392"></a>comrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads,
<a name="393"></a>stood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for all his
<a name="394"></a>great stature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the two corpses lay
<a name="395"></a>stretched on earth near to one another, the one captain of the Thracians
<a name="396"></a>and the other of the Epeans; and many another fell round
<a name="397"></a>them.
<a name="398"></a><br><br>And now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could
<a name="399"></a>have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva leading
<a name="400"></a>him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows.
<a name="401"></a>For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side face
<a name="402"></a>downwards upon the earth.
