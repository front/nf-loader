          <h3>Book V</h3>

<a name="start"></a>

<a name="10"></a>Then Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus,
<a name="11"></a>that he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with glory.
<a name="12"></a>She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet like the star
<a name="13"></a>that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in the waters of
<a name="14"></a>Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his head and shoulders as
<a name="15"></a>she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of the
<a name="16"></a>fight.
<a name="17"></a><br><br>Now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,
<a name="18"></a>priest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and
<a name="19"></a>Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came forward
<a name="20"></a>from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being on foot, while
<a name="21"></a>they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to one another,
<a name="22"></a>Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomed's left shoulder
<a name="23"></a>without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear sped not in vain,
<a name="24"></a>for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell from his
<a name="25"></a>chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother's body, but sprang
<a name="26"></a>from the chariot and took to flight, or he would have shared his brother's
<a name="27"></a>fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by wrapping him in a cloud of darkness,
<a name="28"></a>that his old father might not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the
<a name="29"></a>son of Tydeus drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take them
<a name="30"></a>to the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of Dares,
<a name="31"></a>one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva,
<a name="32"></a>therefore, took Mars by the hand and said, "Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained
<a name="33"></a>stormer of cities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight
<a name="34"></a>it out, and see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let
<a name="35"></a>us go away, and thus avoid his anger."
<a name="36"></a><br><br>So saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon
<a name="37"></a>the steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the Trojans
<a name="38"></a>back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First King Agamemnon
<a name="39"></a>flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his chariot. The spear
<a name="40"></a>of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back, just as he was turning
<a name="41"></a>in flight; it struck him between the shoulders and went right through his
<a name="42"></a>chest, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the
<a name="43"></a>ground.
<a name="44"></a><br><br>Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had
<a name="45"></a>come from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as
<a name="46"></a>he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as
<a name="47"></a>he fell heavily from the car.
<a name="48"></a><br><br>The squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus,
<a name="49"></a>son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman
<a name="50"></a>and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill every
<a name="51"></a>kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but neither she
<a name="52"></a>nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for the spear of Menelaus
<a name="53"></a>struck him in the back as he was flying; it struck him between the shoulders
<a name="54"></a>and went right through his chest, so that he fell headlong and his armour
<a name="55"></a>rang rattling round him.
<a name="56"></a><br><br>Meriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son
<a name="57"></a>of Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning workmanship,
<a name="58"></a>for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that made the ships
<a name="59"></a>for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all mischief, and brought evil
<a name="60"></a>alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus himself; for he heeded not
<a name="61"></a>the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was flying, and struck
<a name="62"></a>him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went through the bone
<a name="63"></a>into the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell forward
<a name="64"></a>on his knees.
<a name="65"></a><br><br>Meges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was
<a name="66"></a>a bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children, for
<a name="67"></a>the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him and
<a name="68"></a>drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue all among
<a name="69"></a>his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in the
<a name="70"></a>dust.
<a name="71"></a><br><br>And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble
<a name="72"></a>Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was honoured
<a name="73"></a>among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him chase as he
<a name="74"></a>was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the arm, and lopped
<a name="75"></a>his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to the ground, and the
<a name="76"></a>shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand, came over his
<a name="77"></a>eyes.
<a name="78"></a><br><br>Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son
<a name="79"></a>of Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or
<a name="80"></a>the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has
<a name="81"></a>burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful vineyards
<a name="82"></a>can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but in a moment
<a name="83"></a>it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that many a strong
<a name="84"></a>man hand has reclaimed- even so were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans
<a name="85"></a>driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they dared
<a name="86"></a>not abide his onslaught.
<a name="87"></a><br><br>Now when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving
<a name="88"></a>the Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part
<a name="89"></a>of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the metal
<a name="90"></a>and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with blood. On this
<a name="91"></a>the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, "Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest
<a name="92"></a>of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold out much longer if King
<a name="93"></a>Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from Lycia hither."
<a name="94"></a><br><br>Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew
<a name="95"></a>and made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.
<a name="96"></a>"Dear son of Capaneus," said he, "come down from your chariot, and draw
<a name="97"></a>the arrow out of my shoulder."
<a name="98"></a><br><br>Sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the
<a name="99"></a>wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been
<a name="100"></a>made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, "Hear me, daughter of aegis-bearing
<a name="101"></a>Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and stood by him in
<a name="102"></a>the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me to come within a
<a name="103"></a>spear's throw of that man and kill him. He has been too quick for me and
<a name="104"></a>has wounded me; and now he is boasting that I shall not see the light of
<a name="105"></a>the sun much longer."
<a name="106"></a><br><br>Thus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs
<a name="107"></a>supple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to
<a name="108"></a>him and said, "Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have
<a name="109"></a>set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover,
<a name="110"></a>I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men apart.
<a name="111"></a>If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not fight
<a name="112"></a>him; but should Jove's daughter Venus come, strike her with your spear
<a name="113"></a>and wound her."
<a name="114"></a><br><br>When she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus
<a name="115"></a>again took his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce
<a name="116"></a>even than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain shepherd
<a name="117"></a>has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall of a sheep-yard
<a name="118"></a>to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused the brute to fury but cannot
<a name="119"></a>defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of the buildings, while
<a name="120"></a>the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one
<a name="121"></a>on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall.
<a name="122"></a>Even thus did Diomed go furiously about among the Trojans.
<a name="123"></a><br><br>He killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a
<a name="124"></a>thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with
<a name="125"></a>a sword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck
<a name="126"></a>and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and Polyidus,
<a name="127"></a>sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came back for him
<a name="128"></a>to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an end of them. He
<a name="129"></a>then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of Phaenops, both of
<a name="130"></a>them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and begat no more
<a name="131"></a>sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took both their lives and left
<a name="132"></a>their father sorrowing bitterly, for he nevermore saw them come home from
<a name="133"></a>battle alive, and his kinsmen divided his wealth among
<a name="134"></a>themselves.
<a name="135"></a><br><br>Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as
<a name="136"></a>they were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on
<a name="137"></a>the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For
<a name="138"></a>all their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and stripped
<a name="139"></a>the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his comrades
<a name="140"></a>to take them back to the ships.
<a name="141"></a><br><br>When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went
<a name="142"></a>through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.
<a name="143"></a>When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, "Pandarus, where is
<a name="144"></a>now your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in respect
<a name="145"></a>of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia that can beat
<a name="146"></a>you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at this fellow who
<a name="147"></a>is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadly work among the
<a name="148"></a>Trojans. He has killed many a brave man- unless indeed he is some god who
<a name="149"></a>is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and has set his hand
<a name="150"></a>against them in his displeasure."
<a name="151"></a><br><br>And the son of Lycaon answered, "Aeneas, I take him for none other
<a name="152"></a>than the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet,
<a name="153"></a>and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is the
<a name="154"></a>man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven's help,
<a name="155"></a>but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and
<a name="156"></a>who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have taken aim at him
<a name="157"></a>already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow went through the breastpiece
<a name="158"></a>of his cuirass; and I made sure I should send him hurrying to the world
<a name="159"></a>below, but it seems that I have not killed him. There must be a god who
<a name="160"></a>is angry with me. Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father's
<a name="161"></a>stables there are eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite
<a name="162"></a>new, with cloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair
<a name="163"></a>of horses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again
<a name="164"></a>and again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots
<a name="165"></a>and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would
<a name="166"></a>not listen to him; it would have been much better if I had done so, but
<a name="167"></a>I was thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill,
<a name="168"></a>and I was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be ill-fed,
<a name="169"></a>so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow
<a name="170"></a>and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains,
<a name="171"></a>the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough,
<a name="172"></a>I have only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow down
<a name="173"></a>from its peg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in Hector's service,
<a name="174"></a>and if ever I get home again to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and
<a name="175"></a>the greatness of my house, may some one cut my head off then and there
<a name="176"></a>if I do not break the bow and set it on a hot fire- such pranks as it plays
<a name="177"></a>me."
<a name="178"></a><br><br>Aeneas answered, "Say no more. Things will not mend till we two
<a name="179"></a>go against this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of
<a name="180"></a>arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can speed
<a name="181"></a>hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove again vouchsafes
<a name="182"></a>glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely back to the city.
<a name="183"></a>Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand upon the car to fight,
<a name="184"></a>or else do you wait this man's onset while I look after the
<a name="185"></a>horses."
<a name="186"></a><br><br>"Aeneas." replied the son of Lycaon, "take the reins and drive;
<a name="187"></a>if we have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for
<a name="188"></a>their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they expect
<a name="189"></a>it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The
<a name="190"></a>son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. Therefore
<a name="191"></a>drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my
<a name="192"></a>spear."
<a name="193"></a><br><br>They then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the
<a name="194"></a>son of Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to
<a name="195"></a>Diomed, "Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes
<a name="196"></a>speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful archer,
<a name="197"></a>Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is Anchises, while
<a name="198"></a>his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us retreat. Do not, I pray
<a name="199"></a>you, press so furiously forward, or you may get killed."
<a name="200"></a><br><br>Diomed looked angrily at him and answered: "Talk not of flight,
<a name="201"></a>for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight
<a name="202"></a>nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount,
<a name="203"></a>but will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid
<a name="204"></a>of no man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take
<a name="205"></a>both back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart- if Minerva
<a name="206"></a>sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your horses here
<a name="207"></a>and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be sure you spring
<a name="208"></a>Aeneas' horses and drive them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. They
<a name="209"></a>are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede,
<a name="210"></a>and are the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stole
<a name="211"></a>the blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon's knowledge, and
<a name="212"></a>they bore him six foals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the
<a name="213"></a>other two to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take
<a name="214"></a>them."
<a name="215"></a><br><br>Thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close
<a name="216"></a>up to them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. "Great and mighty son,"
<a name="217"></a>said he, "of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now
<a name="218"></a>try with my spear."
<a name="219"></a><br><br>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck
<a name="220"></a>the shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed
<a name="221"></a>on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out
<a name="222"></a>and said, "You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out
<a name="223"></a>for long, and the glory of the fight is mine."
<a name="224"></a><br><br>But Diomed all undismayed made answer, "You have missed, not hit,
<a name="225"></a>and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall
<a name="226"></a>glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood."
<a name="227"></a><br><br>With this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus's
<a name="228"></a>nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the bronze
<a name="229"></a>point cut through the root of his to tongue, coming out under his chin,
<a name="230"></a>and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to
<a name="231"></a>the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was reft of life
<a name="232"></a>and strength.
<a name="233"></a><br><br>Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing
<a name="234"></a>lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion in
<a name="235"></a>the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him and a cry of
<a name="236"></a>battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face him.
<a name="237"></a>But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great that
<a name="238"></a>as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft
<a name="239"></a>with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin where the
<a name="240"></a>hip turns in the joint that is called the "cup-bone." The stone crushed
<a name="241"></a>this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged edges tore away
<a name="242"></a>all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and propped himself with his
<a name="243"></a>hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes.
<a name="244"></a>And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished then and there, had not
<a name="245"></a>his mother, Jove's daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchises when
<a name="246"></a>he was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two white arms
<a name="247"></a>about the body of her dear son. She protected him by covering him with
<a name="248"></a>a fold of her own fair garment, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into
<a name="249"></a>his breast and kill him.
<a name="250"></a><br><br>Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the
<a name="251"></a>son of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given him.
<a name="252"></a>He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the
<a name="253"></a>reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas's horses and
<a name="254"></a>drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so done he
<a name="255"></a>gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued above all
<a name="256"></a>others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to take them on
<a name="257"></a>to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and
<a name="258"></a>drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.
<a name="259"></a><br><br>Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear
<a name="260"></a>in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that
<a name="261"></a>can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of cities,
<a name="262"></a>and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew at her and
<a name="263"></a>thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The point tore through
<a name="264"></a>the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for her, and pierced the
<a name="265"></a>skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood,
<a name="266"></a>or ichor, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came pouring from
<a name="267"></a>the wound; for the gods do not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have
<a name="268"></a>no blood such as ours, and are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let
<a name="269"></a>her son fall, but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in
<a name="270"></a>a cloud of darkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast
<a name="271"></a>and kill him; and Diomed shouted out as he left her, "Daughter of Jove,
<a name="272"></a>leave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly
<a name="273"></a>women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder
<a name="274"></a>at the very name of war."
<a name="275"></a><br><br>The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as
<a name="276"></a>the wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all
<a name="277"></a>besmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle, with
<a name="278"></a>his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she fell
<a name="279"></a>on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have his horses.
<a name="280"></a>"Dear brother," she cried, "save me, and give me your horses to take me
<a name="281"></a>to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded by a mortal, the son
<a name="282"></a>of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father Jove."
<a name="283"></a><br><br>Thus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She
<a name="284"></a>mounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her
<a name="285"></a>and took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew
<a name="286"></a>forward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where
<a name="287"></a>the gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them from
<a name="288"></a>the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus flung herself
<a name="289"></a>on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her and caressed
<a name="290"></a>her, saying, "Which of the heavenly beings has been treating you in this
<a name="291"></a>way, as though you had been doing something wrong in the face of
<a name="292"></a>day?"
<a name="293"></a><br><br>And laughter-loving Venus answered, "Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,
<a name="294"></a>wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best of
<a name="295"></a>all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between Trojans
<a name="296"></a>and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with the
<a name="297"></a>immortals."
<a name="298"></a><br><br>"Bear it, my child," replied Dione, "and make the best of it. We
<a name="299"></a>dwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and we
<a name="300"></a>lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and Ephialtes,
<a name="301"></a>children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen months
<a name="302"></a>imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then perished had not
<a name="303"></a>fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury, who stole
<a name="304"></a>him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by the severity of his
<a name="305"></a>bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son of Amphitryon wounded
<a name="306"></a>her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow, and nothing could assuage
<a name="307"></a>her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing
<a name="308"></a>Jove, hit him with an arrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly.
<a name="309"></a>Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full
<a name="310"></a>of pain; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish
<a name="311"></a>till Paeeon healed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades
<a name="312"></a>was not of mortal mould. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of
<a name="313"></a>his sin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has
<a name="314"></a>egged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for not reflecting
<a name="315"></a>that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his children prattling
<a name="316"></a>about his knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus
<a name="317"></a>see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than you are.
<a name="318"></a>Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus, rouse her whole
<a name="319"></a>house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded lord, Diomed the bravest
<a name="320"></a>of the Achaeans."
<a name="321"></a><br><br>So saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with
<a name="322"></a>both hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But Minerva
<a name="323"></a>and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their mocking talk,
<a name="324"></a>and Minerva was first to speak. "Father Jove," said she, "do not be angry
<a name="325"></a>with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been persuading some one of
<a name="326"></a>the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so very fond, and
<a name="327"></a>while caressing one or other of them she must have torn her delicate hand
<a name="328"></a>with the gold pin of the woman's brooch."
<a name="329"></a><br><br>The sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his
<a name="330"></a>side. "My child," said he, "it has not been given you to be a warrior.
<a name="331"></a>Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and leave
<a name="332"></a>all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva."
<a name="333"></a><br><br>Thus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he
<a name="334"></a>knew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the
<a name="335"></a>mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his armour.
<a name="336"></a>Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him, and thrice
<a name="337"></a>did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming on for the
<a name="338"></a>fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him with an awful
<a name="339"></a>voice and said, "Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off; think not to match
<a name="340"></a>yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth cannot hold their own
<a name="341"></a>with the immortals."
<a name="342"></a><br><br>The son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the
<a name="343"></a>anger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him
<a name="344"></a>in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty sanctuary,
<a name="345"></a>Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold, while Apollo
<a name="346"></a>of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness of Aeneas, and armed
<a name="347"></a>as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked at the bucklers about
<a name="348"></a>one another's breasts, hewing each other's round shields and light hide-covered
<a name="349"></a>targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to Mars, "Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained
<a name="350"></a>stormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would
<a name="351"></a>now fight even with father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first
<a name="352"></a>went up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and
<a name="353"></a>afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god."
<a name="354"></a><br><br>He then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars
<a name="355"></a>went about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the likeness
<a name="356"></a>of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. "Sons of Priam," said he, "how
<a name="357"></a>long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans? Would
<a name="358"></a>you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of Anchises
<a name="359"></a>has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as Hector himself. Help me,
<a name="360"></a>then, to rescue our brave comrade from the stress of the
<a name="361"></a>fight."
<a name="362"></a><br><br>With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon
<a name="363"></a>rebuked Hector very sternly. "Hector," said he, "where is your prowess
<a name="364"></a>now? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies you
<a name="365"></a>could hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. I see
<a name="366"></a>not one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it is we, your
<a name="367"></a>allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar, even from
<a name="368"></a>Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my
<a name="369"></a>infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy; nevertheless, I
<a name="370"></a>head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground against any who would fight
<a name="371"></a>me though I have nothing here for the Achaeans to plunder, while you look
<a name="372"></a>on, without even bidding your men stand firm in defence of their wives.
<a name="373"></a>See that you fall not into the hands of your foes as men caught in the
<a name="374"></a>meshes of a net, and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep this before
<a name="375"></a>your mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your allies to hold
<a name="376"></a>on without flinching, and thus put away their reproaches from
<a name="377"></a>you."
<a name="378"></a><br><br>So spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang
<a name="379"></a>from his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host
<a name="380"></a>brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising the
<a name="381"></a>terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the Achaeans,
<a name="382"></a>but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back. As the
<a name="383"></a>breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, when men
<a name="384"></a>are winnowing- while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the chaff
<a name="385"></a>from the grain, and the chaff- heaps grow whiter and whiter- even so did
<a name="386"></a>the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses' hoofs raised to the firmament
<a name="387"></a>of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to battle, and they bore down
<a name="388"></a>with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans, covered them
<a name="389"></a>in a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them, inasmuch as
<a name="390"></a>Phoebus Apollo had told him that when he saw Pallas, Minerva leave the
<a name="391"></a>fray he was to put courage into the hearts of the Trojans- for it was she
<a name="392"></a>who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich
<a name="393"></a>sanctuary, and filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his place
<a name="394"></a>among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and
<a name="395"></a>of a good courage; but they could not ask him how it had all happened,
<a name="396"></a>for they were too busy with the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who
<a name="397"></a>raged insatiably in their midst.
<a name="398"></a><br><br>The two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless
<a name="399"></a>of the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds which
<a name="400"></a>the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is no air
<a name="401"></a>and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whose shrill blasts
<a name="402"></a>scatter the clouds in all directions- even so did the Danaans stand firm
<a name="403"></a>and unflinching against the Trojans. The son of Atreus went about among
<a name="404"></a>them and exhorted them. "My friends," said he, "quit yourselves like brave
<a name="405"></a>men, and shun dishonour in one another's eyes amid the stress of battle.
<a name="406"></a>They that shun dishonour more often live than get killed, but they that
<a name="407"></a>fly save neither life nor name."
<a name="408"></a><br><br>As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in
<a name="409"></a>the front rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the
<a name="410"></a>Trojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever
<a name="411"></a>quick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon
<a name="412"></a>struck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed it not.
<a name="413"></a>It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, and his armour
<a name="414"></a>rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
<a name="415"></a><br><br>Then Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and Orsilochus.
<a name="416"></a>Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of Phere and was
<a name="417"></a>descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream flows through the
<a name="418"></a>land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who ruled over much people
<a name="419"></a>and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and
<a name="420"></a>Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew
<a name="421"></a>up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon
<a name="422"></a>sons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As two lions whom their
<a name="423"></a>dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest to plunder homesteads
<a name="424"></a>and carry off sheep and cattle till they get killed by the hand of man,
<a name="425"></a>so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to
<a name="426"></a>the ground.
<a name="427"></a><br><br>Brave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the
<a name="428"></a>front, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars egged
<a name="429"></a>him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas; but Antilochus
<a name="430"></a>the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing that the king might
<a name="431"></a>come to harm and thus bring all their labour to nothing; when, therefore
<a name="432"></a>Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands and spears against one another
<a name="433"></a>eager to do battle, Antilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus.
<a name="434"></a>Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back on seeing the two heroes side by
<a name="435"></a>side in front of him, so they drew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus
<a name="436"></a>to the ranks of the Achaeans and committed the two poor fellows into the
<a name="437"></a>hands of their comrades. They then turned back and fought in the front
<a name="438"></a>ranks.
<a name="439"></a><br><br>They killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian
<a name="440"></a>warriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on
<a name="441"></a>his chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the
<a name="442"></a>son of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with
<a name="443"></a>a stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell
<a name="444"></a>from his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck
<a name="445"></a>him on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the
<a name="446"></a>chariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and shoulders
<a name="447"></a>buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soil till his horses
<a name="448"></a>kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus lashed them and
<a name="449"></a>drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.
<a name="450"></a><br><br>But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry
<a name="451"></a>rushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.
<a name="452"></a>Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of battle,
<a name="453"></a>while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now in front of Hector
<a name="454"></a>and now behind him.
<a name="455"></a><br><br>Diomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide
<a name="456"></a>plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river rolling
<a name="457"></a>swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts back in fear-
<a name="458"></a>even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his men, "My
<a name="459"></a>friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear so well? Some god
<a name="460"></a>is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars is with him in the likeness
<a name="461"></a>of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore towards the Trojans, but give
<a name="462"></a>ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods."
<a name="463"></a><br><br>As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,
<a name="464"></a>both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in war.
<a name="465"></a>Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up and hurled
<a name="466"></a>his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of great wealth who
<a name="467"></a>lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but his lot had led him
<a name="468"></a>to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck him in the belt;
<a name="469"></a>the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the
<a name="470"></a>ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armour, but the Trojans
<a name="471"></a>rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his shield. He planted
<a name="472"></a>his heel upon the body and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so
<a name="473"></a>heavily upon him that he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders.
<a name="474"></a>The Trojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with
<a name="475"></a>their spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though
<a name="476"></a>he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.
<a name="477"></a><br><br>Thus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong
<a name="478"></a>hand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both brave
<a name="479"></a>and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of
<a name="480"></a>great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke first. "Sarpedon,"
<a name="481"></a>said he, "councillor of the Lycians, why should you come skulking here
<a name="482"></a>you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you son of aegis-bearing
<a name="483"></a>Jove, for you are little like those who were of old his children. Far other
<a name="484"></a>was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father, who came here for the
<a name="485"></a>horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and few men to follow
<a name="486"></a>him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a wilderness of her highways. You
<a name="487"></a>are a coward, and your people are falling from you. For all your strength,
<a name="488"></a>and all your coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but
<a name="489"></a>will pass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand."
<a name="490"></a><br><br>And Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, "Tlepolemus, your
<a name="491"></a>father overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon's folly in refusing payment
<a name="492"></a>to one who had served him well. He would not give your father the horses
<a name="493"></a>which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you shall meet death
<a name="494"></a>by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your soul to Hades of
<a name="495"></a>the noble steeds."
<a name="496"></a><br><br>Thus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw
<a name="497"></a>at the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his throat;
<a name="498"></a>the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell upon his eyes.
<a name="499"></a>Tlepolemus's spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh with such force that
<a name="500"></a>it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, but his father as yet warded
<a name="501"></a>off destruction from him.
<a name="502"></a><br><br>His comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the
<a name="503"></a>weight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in such
<a name="504"></a>haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing the spear
<a name="505"></a>from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the Achaeans
<a name="506"></a>carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was moved to pity,
<a name="507"></a>and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether to pursue
<a name="508"></a>the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was
<a name="509"></a>not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore,
<a name="510"></a>turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor,
<a name="511"></a>Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have slain
<a name="512"></a>yet more, had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the front of the
<a name="513"></a>fight clad in his suit of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon
<a name="514"></a>was glad when he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, "Son of Priam,
<a name="515"></a>let me not he here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and
<a name="516"></a>since I may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my
<a name="517"></a>infant son, let me die within the walls of your city."
<a name="518"></a><br><br>Hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon
<a name="519"></a>the Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon
<a name="520"></a>away and laid him beneath Jove's spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend
<a name="521"></a>and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted and a
<a name="522"></a>mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again, for the breath
<a name="523"></a>of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, and brought
<a name="524"></a>him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.
<a name="525"></a><br><br>Meanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by
<a name="526"></a>Mars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars
<a name="527"></a>was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned
<a name="528"></a>towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars
<a name="529"></a>and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned charioteer,
<a name="530"></a>Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of Oenops, and
<a name="531"></a>Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great wealth, and
<a name="532"></a>dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who lived near him,
<a name="533"></a>owners of a fertile country.
<a name="534"></a><br><br>Now when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said
<a name="535"></a>to Minerva, "Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the promise
<a name="536"></a>we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked the city
<a name="537"></a>of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars rage thus furiously. Let
<a name="538"></a>us go into the fray at once."
<a name="539"></a><br><br>Minerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter
<a name="540"></a>of great Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with
<a name="541"></a>all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either
<a name="542"></a>side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of gold, imperishable,
<a name="543"></a>and over these there was a tire of bronze, wondrous to behold. The naves
<a name="544"></a>of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle upon either side. The
<a name="545"></a>car itself was made with plaited bands of gold and silver, and it had a
<a name="546"></a>double top-rail running all round it. From the body of the car there went
<a name="547"></a>a pole of silver, on to the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with
<a name="548"></a>the bands of gold that were to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno
<a name="549"></a>put her steeds under the yoke, eager for battle and the
<a name="550"></a>war-cry.
<a name="551"></a><br><br>Meanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with
<a name="552"></a>her own hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the shirt of Jove,
<a name="553"></a>arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis about. her shoulders,
<a name="554"></a>wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were Strife, and Strength,
<a name="555"></a>and Panic whose blood runs cold; moreover there was the head of the dread
<a name="556"></a>monster Gorgon,, grim and awful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove.
<a name="557"></a>On her head she set her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to
<a name="558"></a>a peak both in front and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities;
<a name="559"></a>then she stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout
<a name="560"></a>and sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who have
<a name="561"></a>displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed
<a name="562"></a>as they flew open of their own accord -gates over which the flours preside,
<a name="563"></a>in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that
<a name="564"></a>hides them, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient
<a name="565"></a>steeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost ridges
<a name="566"></a>of Olympus. There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of
<a name="567"></a>Saturn, lord of all. "Father Jove," said she, "are you not angry with Mars
<a name="568"></a>for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has
<a name="569"></a>destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason, while
<a name="570"></a>the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and setting this
<a name="571"></a>unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I hope, Father Jove, that
<a name="572"></a>you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and chase him out of the
<a name="573"></a>battle."
<a name="574"></a><br><br>And Jove answered, "Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him
<a name="575"></a>more often than any one else does."
<a name="576"></a><br><br>Juno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward
<a name="577"></a>nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see when
<a name="578"></a>he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the loud-neighing
<a name="579"></a>horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they reached Troy and
<a name="580"></a>the place where its two flowing streams Simois and Scamander meet, there
<a name="581"></a>Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot. She hid them in a thick
<a name="582"></a>cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; the two goddesses
<a name="583"></a>then went on, flying like turtledoves in their eagerness to help the Argives.
<a name="584"></a>When they came to the part where the bravest and most in number were gathered
<a name="585"></a>about mighty Diomed, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength
<a name="586"></a>and endurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced
<a name="587"></a>Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together. "Argives,"
<a name="588"></a>she cried; "shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; as long
<a name="589"></a>as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear was so deadly that the Trojans dared
<a name="590"></a>not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but now they sally far
<a name="591"></a>from the city and fight even at your ships."
<a name="592"></a><br><br>With these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva
<a name="593"></a>sprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his chariot
<a name="594"></a>and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For the sweat
<a name="595"></a>caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield irritated the hurt:
<a name="596"></a>his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up the strap to wipe away
<a name="597"></a>the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his horses and said,
<a name="598"></a>"The son of Tydeus is not such another as his father. Tydeus was a little
<a name="599"></a>man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into the fray even when I told
<a name="600"></a>him not to do so. When he went all unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes
<a name="601"></a>among the Cadmeans, I bade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but
<a name="602"></a>with that high spirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the
<a name="603"></a>youth of the Cadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted,
<a name="604"></a>so mightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid
<a name="605"></a>you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or
<a name="606"></a>you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no
<a name="607"></a>true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus."
<a name="608"></a><br><br>Diomed answered, "I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing
<a name="609"></a>Jove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart,
<a name="610"></a>nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions;
<a name="611"></a>you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if Jove's daughter
<a name="612"></a>Venus came into battle I was to wound her with my spear. Therefore I am
<a name="613"></a>retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather in this place, for I know
<a name="614"></a>that Mars is now lording it in the field."
<a name="615"></a><br><br>"Diomed, son of Tydeus," replied Minerva, "man after my own heart,
<a name="616"></a>fear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend you.
<a name="617"></a>Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear not this
<a name="618"></a>raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on the other.
<a name="619"></a>But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying he would help
<a name="620"></a>the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with the Trojans,
<a name="621"></a>and has forgotten the Argives."
<a name="622"></a><br><br>With this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot
<a name="623"></a>on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the goddess
<a name="624"></a>mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed. The oaken axle
<a name="625"></a>groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and the hero; Pallas
<a name="626"></a>Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight at Mars. He was in
<a name="627"></a>the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the
<a name="628"></a>Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned
<a name="629"></a>the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her; when, therefore, he saw
<a name="630"></a>Diomed, he made straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen.
<a name="631"></a>As soon as they were at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spear
<a name="632"></a>over the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomed's life, but Minerva caught
<a name="633"></a>the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed
<a name="634"></a>then threw, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars's stomach
<a name="635"></a>where his under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing
<a name="636"></a>his fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as loudly
<a name="637"></a>as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans and
<a name="638"></a>Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he
<a name="639"></a>raised.
<a name="640"></a><br><br>As a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat,
<a name="641"></a>even so did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens.
<a name="642"></a>With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great
<a name="643"></a>pain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal
<a name="644"></a>blood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying, "Father
<a name="645"></a>Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are continually suffering
<a name="646"></a>in the most cruel manner at one another's hands while helping mortals;
<a name="647"></a>and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad termagant of a
<a name="648"></a>daughter, who is always committing outrage of some kind. We other gods
<a name="649"></a>must all do as you bid us, but her you neither scold nor punish; you encourage
<a name="650"></a>her because the pestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been
<a name="651"></a>inciting proud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went
<a name="652"></a>up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then
<a name="653"></a>he sprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for it I must
<a name="654"></a>either have lain there for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpes,
<a name="655"></a>or have been eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left in
<a name="656"></a>me."
<a name="657"></a><br><br>Jove looked angrily at him and said, "Do not come whining here,
<a name="658"></a>Sir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for you
<a name="659"></a>are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable and stubborn
<a name="660"></a>spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage her, and it is
<a name="661"></a>her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I cannot let you remain
<a name="662"></a>longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring, and it was by me
<a name="663"></a>that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been the son of any
<a name="664"></a>other god, you are so destructive that by this time you should have been
<a name="665"></a>lying lower than the Titans."
<a name="666"></a><br><br>He then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing
<a name="667"></a>herbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As
<a name="668"></a>the juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though
<a name="669"></a>it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe
<a name="670"></a>washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat by
<a name="671"></a>his father Jove all glorious to behold.
<a name="672"></a><br><br>But Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had
<a name="673"></a>put a stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house
<a name="674"></a>of Jove.
