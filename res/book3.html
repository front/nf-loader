          <h3>Book III</h3>

<a name="start"></a>

<a name="10"></a>When the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain, the Trojans
<a name="11"></a>advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream overhead when rain
<a name="12"></a>and winter drive them over the flowing waters of Oceanus to bring death
<a name="13"></a>and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle in the air as they fly;
<a name="14"></a>but the Achaeans marched silently, in high heart, and minded to stand by
<a name="15"></a>one another.
<a name="16"></a><br><br>As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain
<a name="17"></a>tops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man can
<a name="18"></a>see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust from under
<a name="19"></a>their feet as they made all speed over the plain.
<a name="20"></a><br><br>When they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward
<a name="21"></a>as champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a
<a name="22"></a>panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod with
<a name="23"></a>bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet him in single
<a name="24"></a>fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before the ranks, and was glad
<a name="25"></a>as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of some goat or horned stag,
<a name="26"></a>and devours it there and then, though dogs and youths set upon him. Even
<a name="27"></a>thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of Alexandrus, for he
<a name="28"></a>deemed that now he should be revenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot,
<a name="29"></a>clad in his suit of armour.
<a name="30"></a><br><br>Alexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank
<a name="31"></a>in fear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted,
<a name="32"></a>trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some mountain
<a name="33"></a>glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan warriors,
<a name="34"></a>terror-stricken at the sight of the son Atreus.
<a name="35"></a><br><br>Then Hector upbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris,
<a name="36"></a>fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had never
<a name="37"></a>been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be disgraced
<a name="38"></a>and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us and say that we
<a name="39"></a>have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but who has neither wit
<a name="40"></a>nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, get your following together
<a name="41"></a>and sail beyond the seas? Did you not from your a far country carry off
<a name="42"></a>a lovely woman wedded among a people of warriors- to bring sorrow upon
<a name="43"></a>your father, your city, and your whole country, but joy to your enemies,
<a name="44"></a>and hang-dog shamefacedness to yourself? And now can you not dare face
<a name="45"></a>Menelaus and learn what manner of man he is whose wife you have stolen?
<a name="46"></a>Where indeed would be your lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks
<a name="47"></a>and your fair favour, when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans
<a name="48"></a>are a weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones
<a name="49"></a>for the wrongs you have done them."
<a name="50"></a><br><br>And Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just. You are
<a name="51"></a>hard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the
<a name="52"></a>timber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your
<a name="53"></a>scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus has given me;
<a name="54"></a>they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the gods give them where
<a name="55"></a>they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If you would have
<a name="56"></a>me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats,
<a name="57"></a>while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him
<a name="58"></a>who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and
<a name="59"></a>all she has, to bear them to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn
<a name="60"></a>covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the
<a name="61"></a>others go home to Argos and the land of the Achaeans."
<a name="62"></a><br><br>When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan
<a name="63"></a>ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they all sat
<a name="64"></a>down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with stones and
<a name="65"></a>arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, "Hold, Argives, shoot not,
<a name="66"></a>sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak."
<a name="67"></a><br><br>They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. "Hear
<a name="68"></a>from my mouth," said he, "Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus,
<a name="69"></a>through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and Achaeans
<a name="70"></a>lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight in the midst
<a name="71"></a>of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and
<a name="72"></a>prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them
<a name="73"></a>to his own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of
<a name="74"></a>peace."
<a name="75"></a><br><br>Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of
<a name="76"></a>the loud battle-cry addressed them. "And now," he said, "hear me too, for
<a name="77"></a>it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of Achaeans
<a name="78"></a>and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much have suffered
<a name="79"></a>for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did me. Let him who shall
<a name="80"></a>die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a white
<a name="81"></a>ram and a black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for Jove.
<a name="82"></a>Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may swear to the covenant himself;
<a name="83"></a>for his sons are high-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must
<a name="84"></a>not be transgressed or taken in vain. Young men's minds are light as air,
<a name="85"></a>but when an old man comes he looks before and after, deeming that which
<a name="86"></a>shall be fairest upon both sides."
<a name="87"></a><br><br>The Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they
<a name="88"></a>thought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots toward
<a name="89"></a>the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying it down upon
<a name="90"></a>the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with a little space
<a name="91"></a>between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to bring the lambs
<a name="92"></a>and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius to fetch the other
<a name="93"></a>lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had said.
<a name="94"></a><br><br>Meanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law,
<a name="95"></a>wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodice,
<a name="96"></a>the fairest of Priam's daughters. She found her in her own room, working
<a name="97"></a>at a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering the battles
<a name="98"></a>between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had made them fight for her sake.
<a name="99"></a>Iris then came close up to her and said, "Come hither, child, and see the
<a name="100"></a>strange doings of the Trojans and Achaeans till now they have been warring
<a name="101"></a>upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now they have left off fighting,
<a name="102"></a>and are leaning upon their shields, sitting still with their spears planted
<a name="103"></a>beside them. Alexandrus and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself,
<a name="104"></a>and you are to the the wife of him who is the victor."
<a name="105"></a><br><br>Thus spoke the goddess, and Helen's heart yearned after her former
<a name="106"></a>husband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over her head,
<a name="107"></a>and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone, but attended
<a name="108"></a>by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus, and Clymene. And
<a name="109"></a>straightway they were at the Scaean gates.
<a name="110"></a><br><br>The two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were
<a name="111"></a>seated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius,
<a name="112"></a>and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but they
<a name="113"></a>were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup delicately
<a name="114"></a>from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they saw Helen coming
<a name="115"></a>towards the tower, they said softly to one another, "Small wonder that
<a name="116"></a>Trojans and Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake of
<a name="117"></a>a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. Still, fair though she be,
<a name="118"></a>let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children
<a name="119"></a>after us."
<a name="120"></a><br><br>But Priam bade her draw nigh. "My child," said he, "take your seat
<a name="121"></a>in front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen and your
<a name="122"></a>friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you who are to blame.
<a name="123"></a>It is they that have brought about this terrible war with the Achaeans.
<a name="124"></a>Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and goodly? I have seen
<a name="125"></a>men taller by a head, but none so comely and so royal. Surely he must be
<a name="126"></a>a king."
<a name="127"></a><br><br>"Sir," answered Helen, "father of my husband, dear and reverend
<a name="128"></a>in my eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here
<a name="129"></a>with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling daughter,
<a name="130"></a>and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be, and my lot
<a name="131"></a>is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the hero of whom you
<a name="132"></a>ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and a brave soldier, brother-in-law
<a name="133"></a>as surely as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable
<a name="134"></a>self."
<a name="135"></a><br><br>The old man marvelled at him and said, "Happy son of Atreus, child
<a name="136"></a>of good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great multitudes.
<a name="137"></a>When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of Otreus and of
<a name="138"></a>Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river Sangarius; I was their
<a name="139"></a>ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers of men, came up against them,
<a name="140"></a>but even they were not so many as the Achaeans."
<a name="141"></a><br><br>The old man next looked upon Ulysses; "Tell me," he said, "who
<a name="142"></a>is that other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the
<a name="143"></a>chest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks
<a name="144"></a>in front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his
<a name="145"></a>ewes."
<a name="146"></a><br><br>And Helen answered, "He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of
<a name="147"></a>Laertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of stratagems
<a name="148"></a>and subtle cunning."
<a name="149"></a><br><br>On this Antenor said, "Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once
<a name="150"></a>came here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received them
<a name="151"></a>in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and conversation.
<a name="152"></a>When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans, Menelaus was the
<a name="153"></a>broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses had the more royal
<a name="154"></a>presence. After a time they delivered their message, and the speech of
<a name="155"></a>Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was
<a name="156"></a>a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though
<a name="157"></a>he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses, on the other hand, when he
<a name="158"></a>rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground.
<a name="159"></a>There was no play nor graceful movement of his sceptre; he kept it straight
<a name="160"></a>and stiff like a man unpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for
<a name="161"></a>a mere churl or simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words
<a name="162"></a>came driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then
<a name="163"></a>there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what he looked
<a name="164"></a>like."
<a name="165"></a><br><br>Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, "Who is that great and
<a name="166"></a>goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest of the
<a name="167"></a>Argives?"
<a name="168"></a><br><br>"That," answered Helen, "is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,
<a name="169"></a>and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus looking
<a name="170"></a>like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him. Often did Menelaus
<a name="171"></a>receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting us from Crete.
<a name="172"></a>I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but
<a name="173"></a>there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux
<a name="174"></a>the mighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to myself.
<a name="175"></a>Either they have not left Lacedaemon, or else, though they have brought
<a name="176"></a>their ships, they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and
<a name="177"></a>disgrace that I have brought upon them."
<a name="178"></a><br><br>She knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the
<a name="179"></a>earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.
<a name="180"></a><br><br>Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through
<a name="181"></a>the city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and Idaeus
<a name="182"></a>brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to Priam and said,
<a name="183"></a>"Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans bid you come
<a name="184"></a>down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus
<a name="185"></a>are to fight for Helen in single combat, that she and all her wealth may
<a name="186"></a>go with him who is the victor. We are to swear to a solemn covenant of
<a name="187"></a>peace whereby we others shall dwell here in Troy, while the Achaeans return
<a name="188"></a>to Argos and the land of the Achaeans."
<a name="189"></a><br><br>The old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the
<a name="190"></a>horses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot, gathered
<a name="191"></a>the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him; they then
<a name="192"></a>drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they reached the ranks
<a name="193"></a>of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot, and with measured pace
<a name="194"></a>advanced into the space between the hosts.
<a name="195"></a><br><br>Agamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought
<a name="196"></a>on the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they poured
<a name="197"></a>water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus drew the
<a name="198"></a>dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs' heads; this
<a name="199"></a>the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean princes, and the
<a name="200"></a>son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. "Father Jove," he cried, "that
<a name="201"></a>rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and thou oh Sun, that seest and
<a name="202"></a>givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers, and ye who in the realms below
<a name="203"></a>chastise the soul of him that has broken his oath, witness these rites
<a name="204"></a>and guard them, that they be not vain. If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let
<a name="205"></a>him keep Helen and all her wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but
<a name="206"></a>if Menelaus kills Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that
<a name="207"></a>she has; let them moreover pay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be agreed
<a name="208"></a>upon, in testimony among those that shall be born hereafter. Aid if Priam
<a name="209"></a>and his sons refuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay
<a name="210"></a>here and fight on till I have got satisfaction."
<a name="211"></a><br><br>As he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims,
<a name="212"></a>and laid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had
<a name="213"></a>reft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl
<a name="214"></a>into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans and
<a name="215"></a>Achaeans among one another, "Jove, most great and glorious, and ye other
<a name="216"></a>everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall first sin against
<a name="217"></a>their oaths- of them and their children- may be shed upon the ground even
<a name="218"></a>as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of
<a name="219"></a>strangers."
<a name="220"></a><br><br>Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.
<a name="221"></a>Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojans and
<a name="222"></a>Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: I dare not
<a name="223"></a>with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and Menelaus, for Jove
<a name="224"></a>and the other immortals alone know which shall fall."
<a name="225"></a><br><br>On this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat.
<a name="226"></a>He gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two
<a name="227"></a>then went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and cast
<a name="228"></a>lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first. Meanwhile
<a name="229"></a>the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying, "Father Jove, that
<a name="230"></a>rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he who first brought
<a name="231"></a>about this war between us may die, and enter the house of Hades, while
<a name="232"></a>we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths."
<a name="233"></a><br><br>Great Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,
<a name="234"></a>and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several stations,
<a name="235"></a>each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying, while Alexandrus,
<a name="236"></a>husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour. First he greaved his
<a name="237"></a>legs with greaves of good make and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver;
<a name="238"></a>after this he donned the cuirass of his brother Lycaon, and fitted it to
<a name="239"></a>his own body; he hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders,
<a name="240"></a>and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought,
<a name="241"></a>with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped
<a name="242"></a>a redoubtable spear that suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also
<a name="243"></a>put on his armour.
<a name="244"></a><br><br>When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode
<a name="245"></a>fierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans were
<a name="246"></a>struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the
<a name="247"></a>measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against the
<a name="248"></a>other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son of
<a name="249"></a>Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its point.
<a name="250"></a>Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as he did so. "King Jove,"
<a name="251"></a>he said, "grant me revenge on Alexandrus who has wronged me; subdue him
<a name="252"></a>under my hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrink from doing ill
<a name="253"></a>deeds in the house of his host."
<a name="254"></a><br><br>He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of
<a name="255"></a>Alexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt by his
<a name="256"></a>flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then the
<a name="257"></a>son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of his helmet,
<a name="258"></a>but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from his hand, and
<a name="259"></a>he cried, looking towards Heaven, "Father Jove, of all gods thou art the
<a name="260"></a>most despiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the sword has broken in
<a name="261"></a>my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have not killed
<a name="262"></a>him."
<a name="263"></a><br><br>With this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume
<a name="264"></a>of his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap of
<a name="265"></a>the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus would
<a name="266"></a>have dragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove's daughter Venus
<a name="267"></a>been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that the empty
<a name="268"></a>helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades among the Achaeans,
<a name="269"></a>and was again springing upon Alexandrus to run him through with a spear,
<a name="270"></a>but Venus snatched him up in a moment (as a god can do), hid him under
<a name="271"></a>a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own bedchamber.
<a name="272"></a><br><br>Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with
<a name="273"></a>the Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman
<a name="274"></a>who used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and of
<a name="275"></a>whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robe
<a name="276"></a>and said, "Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the house; he
<a name="277"></a>is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in gorgeous
<a name="278"></a>apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting, but rather
<a name="279"></a>that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was sitting
<a name="280"></a>down."
<a name="281"></a><br><br>With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she
<a name="282"></a>marked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling
<a name="283"></a>eyes, she marvelled at her and said, "Goddess, why do you thus beguile
<a name="284"></a>me? Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom you
<a name="285"></a>have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished Alexandrus,
<a name="286"></a>and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are come here to betray
<a name="287"></a>me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be goddess no longer; never
<a name="288"></a>let your feet carry you back to Olympus; worry about him and look after
<a name="289"></a>him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave- but
<a name="290"></a>me? I shall not go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word
<a name="291"></a>among all the women of Troy. Besides, I have trouble on my
<a name="292"></a>mind."
<a name="293"></a><br><br>Venus was very angry, and said, "Bold hussy, do not provoke me;
<a name="294"></a>if you do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I have
<a name="295"></a>loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans, and
<a name="296"></a>you shall come to a bad end."
<a name="297"></a><br><br>At this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her
<a name="298"></a>and went in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan
<a name="299"></a>women.
<a name="300"></a><br><br>When they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set
<a name="301"></a>about their work, but Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving
<a name="302"></a>goddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this Helen,
<a name="303"></a>daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance began to
<a name="304"></a>upbraid her husband.
<a name="305"></a><br><br>"So you are come from the fight," said she; "would that you had
<a name="306"></a>fallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You used
<a name="307"></a>to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus.
<a name="308"></a>go, but I then, an challenge him again- but I should advise you not to
<a name="309"></a>do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you
<a name="310"></a>will soon all by his spear."
<a name="311"></a><br><br>And Paris answered, "Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches.
<a name="312"></a>This time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me; another
<a name="313"></a>time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by me.
<a name="314"></a>Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Never yet was I so passionately
<a name="315"></a>enamoured of you as at this moment- not even when I first carried you off
<a name="316"></a>from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you- not even when I had converse
<a name="317"></a>with you upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae was I so enthralled
<a name="318"></a>by desire of you as now." On this he led her towards the bed, and his wife
<a name="319"></a>went with him.
<a name="320"></a><br><br>Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus
<a name="321"></a>strode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no man,
<a name="322"></a>neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they had seen
<a name="323"></a>him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them hated him as
<a name="324"></a>they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men, spoke, saying, "Hear
<a name="325"></a>me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory has been with Menelaus;
<a name="326"></a>therefore give back Helen with all her wealth, and pay such fine as shall
<a name="327"></a>be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall be born
<a name="328"></a>hereafter."
<a name="329"></a><br><br>Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in
<a name="330"></a>applause.
